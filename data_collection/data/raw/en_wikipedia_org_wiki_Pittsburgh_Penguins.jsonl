The Penguins compete in the [National Hockey League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League \"National Hockey League\") (NHL) as a member of the [Metropolitan Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Division \"Metropolitan Division\") in the [Eastern Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL) \"Eastern Conference (NHL)\"). The team has played its home games at [PPG Paints Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena \"PPG Paints Arena\") since 2010, and has previously played at the [Civic Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Arena_(Pittsburgh) \"Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)\"), which was better known by its nickname \"the Igloo\". The Penguins are affiliated with two [minor league](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_league \"Minor league\") teams – the [Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkes-Barre/Scranton_Penguins \"Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins\") of the [American Hockey League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League \"American Hockey League\") (AHL) and the [Wheeling Nailers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeling_Nailers \"Wheeling Nailers\") of the [ECHL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHL \"ECHL\").\n\nFounded during the [1967 expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_NHL_expansion \"1967 NHL expansion\"), the Penguins have qualified for six [Stanley Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Final \"Stanley Cup Final\"), winning the [Stanley Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup \"Stanley Cup\") five times – in [1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990%E2%80%9391_NHL_season \"1990–91 NHL season\"), [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991%E2%80%9392_NHL_season \"1991–92 NHL season\"), [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_NHL_season \"2008–09 NHL season\"), [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_NHL_season \"2015–16 NHL season\"), and [2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_NHL_season \"2016–17 NHL season\"). Along with the [Edmonton Oilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers \"Edmonton Oilers\"), the Penguins are tied for the most [Stanley Cup championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Stanley_Cup_champions \"List of Stanley Cup champions\") among the non- [Original Six](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Six \"Original Six\") teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in the [salary cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_salary_cap \"NHL salary cap\") era. Several of the team's former members have been inducted into the [Hockey Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Hall_of_Fame \"Hockey Hall of Fame\"), including co-owner [Mario Lemieux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lemieux \"Mario Lemieux\"), who purchased the Penguins in 1999 and brought the club out of bankruptcy. Lemieux, [Jaromir Jagr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarom%C3%ADr_J%C3%A1gr \"Jaromír Jágr\"), [Sidney Crosby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Crosby \"Sidney Crosby\"), and [Evgeni Malkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeni_Malkin \"Evgeni Malkin\") have won the [Hart Memorial Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_Memorial_Trophy \"Hart Memorial Trophy\") while playing for the franchise.\n\n## History\n\n### Early years (1967–1984)\n\nPrior to the arrival of the Penguins, Pittsburgh had been the home of the NHL's [Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates_(NHL) \"Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)\") from 1925 to 1930 and of the [American Hockey League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League \"American Hockey League\")'s [Pittsburgh Hornets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Hornets \"Pittsburgh Hornets\") franchise from 1936 to 1967 (with a short break from 1956 to 1961). In the spring of 1965, [Jack McGregor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_McGregor \"Jack McGregor\"), a [state senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_senator \"State senator\") from [Kittanning, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittanning,_Pennsylvania \"Kittanning, Pennsylvania\"), began lobbying campaign contributors and community leaders to bring an NHL franchise back to Pittsburgh. The group focused on leveraging the NHL as an [urban renewal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_renewal \"Urban renewal\") tool for Pittsburgh. The senator formed a group of local investors that included [H. J. Heinz Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._J._Heinz_Company \"H. J. Heinz Company\") heir [H. J. Heinz III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._John_Heinz_III \"H. John Heinz III\"), [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")' owner [Art Rooney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Rooney \"Art Rooney\") and the [Mellon family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellon_family \"Mellon family\")'s [Richard Mellon Scaife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mellon_Scaife \"Richard Mellon Scaife\"). The [projected league expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_NHL_expansion \"1967 NHL expansion\") depended on securing votes from the [then-current NHL owners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Six \"Original Six\"); to ensure Pittsburgh would be selected as one of the expansion cities, McGregor enlisted Rooney to petition votes from [James D. Norris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Norris \"James D. Norris\"), owner of the [Chicago Black Hawks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Blackhawks \"Chicago Blackhawks\") and his brother [Bruce Norris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Norris_(ice_hockey) \"Bruce Norris (ice hockey)\"), owner of the [Detroit Red Wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings \"Detroit Red Wings\"). The effort was successful, and on February 8, 1966, the [National Hockey League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League \"National Hockey League\") awarded an [expansion team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_team \"Expansion team\") to Pittsburgh for the [1967–68 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967%E2%80%9368_NHL_season \"1967–68 NHL season\"). The Penguins paid $2.5 million ($24.5 million today) for their entry and $750,000 ($7.1 million today) more for start-up costs. The [Civic Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Arena_(Pittsburgh) \"Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)\")'s capacity was boosted from 10,732 to 12,500 to meet the NHL requirements for expansion. The Penguins also paid an indemnification bill to settle with the Detroit Red Wings, which owned the Pittsburgh Hornets franchise. The investor group named McGregor president and chief executive officer, and he represented Pittsburgh on the NHL's Board of Governors.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-Steel_City_Legend-5)[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2016-6)\n\n[![Photograph of the Civic Arena](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Pittsburgh-pennsylvania-mellon-arena-2007.jpg/250px-Pittsburgh-pennsylvania-mellon-arena-2007.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pittsburgh-pennsylvania-mellon-arena-2007.jpg) The [Civic Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Arena_(Pittsburgh) \"Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)\")'s capacity was increased to meet NHL requirements for a franchise. The arena served as the Penguins' home arena from 1967 to 2010.\n\nA contest was held where 700 of 26,000 entries picked \"Penguins\" as the team's nickname, sharing its nickname with the [athletic department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown_State_Penguins \"Youngstown State Penguins\") of the newly named [Youngstown State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown_State_University \"Youngstown State University\") in nearby [Youngstown, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown,_Ohio \"Youngstown, Ohio\"). (Youngstown is part of the Penguins' territorial rights to this day, though they did briefly share them with the [Cleveland Barons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Barons_(NHL) \"Cleveland Barons (NHL)\") in the mid-1970s.) Mark Peters had the winning entry (which was inspired because the team was to play in the \"Igloo\", the nickname of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena),[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-PenguinsHistoryNHLcom-7)[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-8) a logo was chosen that had a penguin in front of a triangle, which symbolized the \" [Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Pittsburgh) \"Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh)\")\" of downtown Pittsburgh.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-PenguinsHistoryNHLcom-7)[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-9) The Penguins' first general manager, [Jack Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Riley_(ice_hockey,_born_1919) \"Jack Riley (ice hockey, born 1919)\"), opened the first pre-season camp for the franchise in [Brantford, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brantford,_Ontario \"Brantford, Ontario\"),[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-10) on September 13, 1967, playing the franchise's first exhibition match in Brantford against the [Philadelphia Flyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers \"Philadelphia Flyers\") on September 23, 1967. Restrictive rules which kept most major talent with the existing \"Original Six\" teams hampered the Penguins, along with the rest of the expansion teams. Beyond aging sniper [Andy Bathgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Bathgate \"Andy Bathgate\"), all-star defenseman [Leo Boivin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Boivin \"Leo Boivin\") (who had begun his professional career with the Hornets) and [New York Rangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers \"New York Rangers\")' veteran [Earl Ingarfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Ingarfield,_Sr. \"Earl Ingarfield, Sr.\"), a cast of former minor leaguers largely manned the first Penguins' team. Several players played for the Hornets the previous season: Bathgate, wingers [Val Fonteyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Fonteyne \"Val Fonteyne\") and [Ab McDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_McDonald \"Ab McDonald\"), and goaltenders [Hank Bassen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Bassen \"Hank Bassen\") and [Joe Daley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Daley_(ice_hockey) \"Joe Daley (ice hockey)\"). [George Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sullivan_(ice_hockey) \"George Sullivan (ice hockey)\") was named the head coach for the club's first two seasons, and McDonald was named the team's first captain.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2010-11)\n\nOn October 11, 1967, league president [Clarence Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Campbell \"Clarence Campbell\") and McGregor jointly dropped the ceremonial first puck of the Penguins' opening home game against the [Montreal Canadiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens \"Montreal Canadiens\").[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-Steel_City_Legend-5) On October 21, 1967, they became the first team from the expansion class to defeat an Original Six team, as they defeated the Chicago Black Hawks 4–2. However, the Penguins went 27–34–13 and finished in fifth place in the West Division, missing the playoffs and ending with the third-worst record in the league. The team's best player proved to be longtime [Cleveland Barons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Barons_(1937%E2%80%9373) \"Cleveland Barons (1937–73)\") AHL goaltender [Les Binkley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Binkley \"Les Binkley\"), who recorded a 2.88 [goals-against average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals-against_average \"Goals-against average\") and was second in the league with six shutouts. Defensive winger [Ken Schinkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Schinkel \"Ken Schinkel\") won the team's sole league honor, being named to represent the Penguins in the [NHL All-Star Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_National_Hockey_League_All-Star_Game \"21st National Hockey League All-Star Game\"). Bathgate led the team in scoring with 59 points but retired at season's end. McDonald, who led the team in goals and was second in team scoring, was also gone at season's end, traded to the [St. Louis Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Blues \"St. Louis Blues\") in exchange for center [Lou Angotti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Angotti \"Lou Angotti\").[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2016-6)\n\nThe [next season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968%E2%80%9369_NHL_season \"1968–69 NHL season\") saw the team slip in the standings amid a sharp drop in form by Binkley, into sixth place and with the league's worst record. Several changes were made to improve the team, resulting in Boivin and several others being traded, and new players – including longtime future Penguins star [Jean Pronovost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Pronovost \"Jean Pronovost\") – making their debuts. No captain was named to replace McDonald; the team went with four alternate captains.\n\n#### Triumph of playoff berths and tragedy of Briere (1969–1974)\n\n[![Photograph of Michele Briere whose number was taken out of circulation following a fatal accident](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3b/Michel_Briere_Penguins.jpg/180px-Michel_Briere_Penguins.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Michel_Briere_Penguins.jpg) [Michel Briere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bri%C3%A8re \"Michel Brière\")'s number was taken out of circulation after his career-ending accident in 1970. It was later formally retired in 2001.\n\nIn the [1969 draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_NHL_amateur_draft \"1969 NHL amateur draft\") the Penguins selected [Michel Briere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Bri%C3%A8re \"Michel Brière\") who, although being chosen 26th, was soon drawing comparisons to [Phil Esposito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Esposito \"Phil Esposito\") and [Bobby Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Clarke \"Bobby Clarke\"). Joining the team in November, he finished as the second-place rookie scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in [Calder Memorial Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Memorial_Trophy \"Calder Memorial Trophy\") voting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago goaltender [Tony Esposito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Esposito \"Tony Esposito\"). Briere led Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. The Penguins defeated the [Oakland Seals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Seals \"Oakland Seals\") in a four-game sweep in the quarterfinals, with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semifinals, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording five goals (including three game-winners) and eight points. Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May 15, 1970, Briere was in a car crash in his native [Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec \"Quebec\"), suffering brain trauma and slipping into a coma from which he would never recover; he died a year later. His number 21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation until it was formally retired in 2001.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2016-6)\n\nIn the [1970–71 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970%E2%80%9371_NHL_season \"1970–71 NHL season\"), the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 21–37–20 record, the fourth-worst record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in [1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971%E2%80%9372_NHL_season \"1971–72 NHL season\"), only to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round. Except for a handful of players like Ken Schinkel, Pronovost, [Syl Apps Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syl_Apps_Jr. \"Syl Apps Jr.\"), [Keith McCreary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_McCreary \"Keith McCreary\"), agitator [Bryan Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Watson_(ice_hockey) \"Bryan Watson (ice hockey)\") and goaltender Les Binkley, talent was thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972.\n\nThe Penguins battled the [California Golden Seals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Golden_Seals \"California Golden Seals\") for the division cellar in [1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973%E2%80%9374_NHL_season \"1973–74 NHL season\"), when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced by [Jack Button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Button \"Jack Button\"). Button obtained [Steve Durbano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Durbano \"Steve Durbano\"), [Ab DeMarco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_DeMarco,_Jr. \"Ab DeMarco, Jr.\"), [Bob \"Battleship\" Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Bob_Kelly \"J. Bob Kelly\") and [Bob Paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Paradise \"Bob Paradise\") through trades. The personnel moves proved successful, and the team improved to a 28–41–9 record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth.\n\nHowever, in early 1975, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, forcing the team into [bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy \"Bankruptcy\"). The doors to the team's offices were padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins would fold or relocate.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-12) Around the same time, rumors began circulating that the Penguins and the California Golden Seals were to be relocated to [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle \"Seattle\") and [Denver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver \"Denver\") respectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the [1976–77 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976%E2%80%9377_NHL_season \"1976–77 NHL season\").[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-13) Through the intervention of a group that included former [Minnesota North Stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_North_Stars \"Minnesota North Stars\") head coach [Wren Blair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wren_Blair \"Wren Blair\"), the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought by [shopping mall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall \"Shopping mall\") magnate [Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_J._DeBartolo,_Sr. \"Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.\")\n\n#### Playoff runs and a uniform change (1974–1982)\n\n[![Photograph of Lowell MacDonald holding his hockey stick on the ice](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Lowell_MacDonald.jpg/250px-Lowell_MacDonald.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lowell_MacDonald.jpg) During the mid-1970s, [Lowell MacDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_MacDonald \"Lowell MacDonald\") was paired with [Syl Apps Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syl_Apps_Jr. \"Syl Apps Jr.\") and [Jean Pronovost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Pronovost \"Jean Pronovost\"), forming the \"Century [Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(ice_hockey) \"Line (ice hockey)\")\". MacDonald played with the Penguins from 1970 to 1978.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the \"Century Line\" of Syl Apps, [Lowell MacDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_MacDonald \"Lowell MacDonald\") and Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the semifinals in [1975](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974%E2%80%9375_NHL_season \"1974–75 NHL season\"), but were ousted from the playoffs by the [New York Islanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Islanders \"New York Islanders\") in one of the only four best-of-seven-game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. As the 1970s wore on, a mediocre team defense neutralized the Penguins' success beyond the regular season. [Baz Bastien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baz_Bastien \"Baz Bastien\"), a former coach and general manager of the AHL's Hornets, later became general manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in [1977–78](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977%E2%80%9378_NHL_season \"1977–78 NHL season\"). Bastien traded prime draft picks for several players whose best years were already behind them, and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over the [Buffalo Sabres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres \"Buffalo Sabres\") before a second-round sweep at the hands of the [Boston Bruins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins \"Boston Bruins\").[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2016-6)\n\nThe Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors; in January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, the [Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates \"Pittsburgh Pirates\") and the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as the [Flag of Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania \"Flag of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\"). Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both had enjoyed world championship seasons. The Bruins protested this color change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended their choice stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional sporting colors. The NHL agreed, and Pittsburgh could use black and gold. The Penguins officially debuted the black and gold uniform in a game against the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30, 1980.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-14) On the ice, the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman [Randy Carlyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Carlyle \"Randy Carlyle\"), and prolific scorers [Paul Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gardner_(ice_hockey) \"Paul Gardner (ice hockey)\") and [Mike Bullard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bullard_(ice_hockey) \"Mike Bullard (ice hockey)\") but little else.\n\nDuring the early part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th-seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first-round playoff series. The following season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the [1982 playoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Stanley_Cup_playoffs \"1982 Stanley Cup playoffs\"), the Penguins held a 3–1 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by [John Tonelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tonelli \"John Tonelli\"), who had tied the game before.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-15) It would be the Penguins' final playoff appearance until [1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Stanley_Cup_playoffs \"1989 Stanley Cup playoffs\").\n\n### Lemieux–Jagr era (1984–2005)\n\n[![Photograph of Mario Lemieux holding a stick and skating](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Mario_Lemieux_1992.jpg/250px-Mario_Lemieux_1992.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mario_Lemieux_1992.jpg) [Mario Lemieux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lemieux \"Mario Lemieux\") played for the Penguins in two stints (1984–1997, 2000–2006).\n\nThe team had the league's worst record in both the [1982–83](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982%E2%80%9383_NHL_season \"1982–83 NHL season\") and [1983–84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983%E2%80%9384_NHL_season \"1983–84 NHL season\") seasons. With the team suffering financial problems, it seemed the Penguins would either fold or relocate. [Mario Lemieux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lemieux \"Mario Lemieux\"), one of the most highly touted NHL draft picks in history, was due to be drafted in the [1984 NHL entry draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_NHL_entry_draft \"1984 NHL entry draft\"). Heading towards the end of the season ahead of the [New Jersey Devils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils \"New Jersey Devils\"), who were placed last, the Penguins made several questionable moves that appeared to weaken the team in the short term. They posted three six-game winless streaks in the last 21 games of the season and earned the right to draft Lemieux amidst protests from Devils' management.[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-16) Pittsburgh head coach Lou Angotti later admitted that a conscious decision was made to finish the season as the team with the worst record, saying in an interview with the _[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\")_ that a mid-season lunch prompted the plan, because there was a high chance of the franchise folding if Lemieux was not drafted.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-Angotti-17) Other teams offered substantial trade packages for the draft choice, but the Penguins kept the pick and drafted Lemieux first overall. Lemieux paid dividends right away, scoring on his first-ever shot of his first-ever NHL shift in his first NHL game. However, the team spent four more years out of the playoffs after his arrival. In the late 1980s, the Penguins finally gave Lemieux a strong supporting cast, trading for superstar defenseman [Paul Coffey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Coffey \"Paul Coffey\") from the [Edmonton Oilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers \"Edmonton Oilers\") (after the Oilers' [1987 Stanley Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Stanley_Cup_Final \"1987 Stanley Cup Final\") win) and bringing in young talent like scorers [Kevin Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stevens \"Kevin Stevens\"), [Rob Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Brown_(ice_hockey) \"Rob Brown (ice hockey)\") and [John Cullen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cullen \"John Cullen\") from the minors. The team finally acquired a top-flight goaltender with the acquisition of [Tom Barrasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Barrasso \"Tom Barrasso\") from Buffalo. All this talent had an immediate impact in helping Lemieux lead the Penguins; but the team struggled to make the playoffs. In [1985–86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985%E2%80%9386_NHL_season \"1985–86 NHL season\"), the Penguins missed the playoffs on the final day of the season by one game. In [1986–87](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986%E2%80%9387_NHL_season \"1986–87 NHL season\"), they missed the playoffs by just two games and saw four teams with equal or worse records qualify. In [1987–88](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987%E2%80%9388_NHL_season \"1987–88 NHL season\"), for the second time in a row, the Penguins missed the playoffs by one game.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2010-11)\n\nIn 1989, Pittsburgh finally broke through the barrier and made the playoffs on the back of Lemieux leading the league in goals, assists and points. On December 31, 1988, Lemieux became the only player in history to score a goal in all five possible game situations in the same game (even strength, shorthanded, penalty shot, power play, and empty net). The Penguins defeated the New York Rangers in a four-game sweep in the first round; however, the Philadelphia Flyers halted their progress in the second round. The seven-game defeat featured Lemieux scoring five goals in the fifth game.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2010-11)\n\n#### Back-to-back Stanley Cup titles (1989–1997)\n\nA [herniated disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herniated_disc \"Herniated disc\") in Lemieux's back cut short his [1989–90 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989%E2%80%9390_NHL_season \"1989–90 NHL season\"), although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free-agent signings ( [Bryan Trottier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Trottier \"Bryan Trottier\")) and trades ( [Joe Mullen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mullen \"Joe Mullen\"), [Larry Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Murphy_(ice_hockey) \"Larry Murphy (ice hockey)\"), [Ron Francis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Francis \"Ron Francis\") and [Ulf Samuelsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulf_Samuelsson \"Ulf Samuelsson\")) played a major part in this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted [Jaromir Jagr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarom%C3%ADr_J%C3%A1gr \"Jaromír Jágr\") with the fifth overall pick in the [1990 NHL entry draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_NHL_entry_draft \"1990 NHL entry draft\"). The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent.\nThe roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the [Stanley Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Final \"Stanley Cup Final\") in six games, punctuated by an 8–0 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the [1991 Stanley Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Stanley_Cup_Final \"1991 Stanley Cup Final\"), the Penguins met with President [George H. W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush \"George H. W. Bush\"), the first NHL team ever to visit the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House \"White House\").[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-18) The following season, the team lost coach [Bob Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Johnson_(ice_hockey,_born_1931) \"Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)\") to [cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer \"Cancer\"), and [Scotty Bowman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotty_Bowman \"Scotty Bowman\") took over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in [1991–92](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991%E2%80%9392_NHL_season \"1991–92 NHL season\").[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2016-6)[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2010-11)\n\nCancer diagnosis revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was diagnosed with [Hodgkin lymphoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin_lymphoma \"Hodgkin lymphoma\"). Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth [Art Ross Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Ross_Trophy \"Art Ross Trophy\") as scoring champion with 160 points, edging out [Pat LaFontaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_LaFontaine \"Pat LaFontaine\") and [Adam Oates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Oates \"Adam Oates\"). Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56–21–7 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning the [Presidents' Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents%27_Trophy \"Presidents' Trophy\"). After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of the success, the [1993 playoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Stanley_Cup_playoffs \"1993 Stanley Cup playoffs\") ended in the division finals when the New York Islanders eliminated the Penguins in seven games.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2010-11)[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2016-6)\n\nThe Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards: [Alexei Kovalev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Kovalev \"Alexei Kovalev\"), [Martin Straka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Straka \"Martin Straka\"), [Aleksey Morozov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Morozov \"Alexei Morozov\"), [Robert Lang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lang_(ice_hockey) \"Robert Lang (ice hockey)\") and [Petr Nedved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr_Nedv%C4%9Bd \"Petr Nedvěd\"), and defensemen [Sergei Zubov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Zubov \"Sergei Zubov\"), [Darius Kasparaitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_Kasparaitis \"Darius Kasparaitis\") and [Kevin Hatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hatcher \"Kevin Hatcher\"). Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 (where they lost to the [Washington Capitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals \"Washington Capitals\") in six games), the second round in 1995 (where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games) and the conference finals in 1996 (where they lost to the [Florida Panthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers \"Florida Panthers\") in seven games). The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2010-11)\n\n#### Lemieux's retirement and return (1997–2001)\n\n[![Photograph of Mario Lemieux on the ice holding a hockey stick](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Mario_Lemieux_2001.jpg/250px-Mario_Lemieux_2001.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mario_Lemieux_2001.jpg) Lemieux with the Penguins during the [2000–01 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_NHL_season \"2000–01 NHL season\"), his first season after coming out of retirement.\n\nOn April 6, 1997, the franchise was rocked when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns and his disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into the [Hockey Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Hall_of_Fame \"Hockey Hall of Fame\") in the year he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. His departure was the first in a series of events that would once again lead the Penguins into regular season stagnation, and to the brink of financial ruin.\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens eliminated the team in the first round of the playoffs in 1998, despite being the second-seeded team in the East. The following year, their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the [Toronto Maple Leafs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs \"Toronto Maple Leafs\") in six games. In 2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4–1 in the first round, only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4–2 in the second round.\n\nBy this time, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were catching up with the Penguins. At one point, the team owed over $90 million to numerous creditors, leading then-owners [Howard Baldwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Baldwin \"Howard Baldwin\") and [Morris Belzberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Belzberg \"Morris Belzberg\") (who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win) to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for [Chapter 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code \"Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code\") bankruptcy in November 1998.\n\nLemieux then stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed Lemieux $32.5 million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equity – enough to give him controlling interest. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoon [Ronald Burkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Burkle \"Ronald Burkle\")) assumed control on September 3, 1999, saving the franchise for the second time.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2016-6)\n\nLemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player–owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the [2001 playoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Stanley_Cup_playoffs \"2001 Stanley Cup playoffs\"), highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in game 7 of the second round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the conference finals, where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2016-6)\n\n#### Rebuilding (2001–2005)\n\n[![Photograph of goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury waering his face mask](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Marc-Andre_Fleury_2014-12-12.JPG/250px-Marc-Andre_Fleury_2014-12-12.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marc-Andre_Fleury_2014-12-12.JPG) [Marc-Andre Fleury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc-Andr%C3%A9_Fleury \"Marc-André Fleury\") was drafted first overall in [2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_NHL_entry_draft \"2003 NHL entry draft\") by the Penguins.\n\nThe Penguins' attendance had dwindled in the late 1990s. In 1998–99, the club had an average attendance of 14,825 at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-attendance-19) Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_NHL_season \"2001–02 NHL season\"), finishing in a tie for third-to-last in their conference. The [following season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002%E2%80%9303_NHL_season \"2002–03 NHL season\") they finished second-last. In the [2003 NHL entry draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_NHL_entry_draft \"2003 NHL entry draft\"), the Penguins selected goaltender [Marc-Andre Fleury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc-Andr%C3%A9_Fleury \"Marc-André Fleury\") with the first overall pick.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-20)[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-21)\n\nThe [2003–04 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_NHL_season \"2003–04 NHL season\") was an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but 24 regular season games with a hip injury, and attendance dipping to an average of 11,877 (the lowest average of any NHL team), with just one sellout.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-attendance-19) As the season progressed, the Penguins signed new head coach (and former Penguins' player and commentator) [Eddie Olczyk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Olczyk \"Eddie Olczyk\") and opted not to include Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the season. This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, with the team winning just 23 games. As in the 1980s, the Penguins' struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL entry draft classes that would yield multiple world-class talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the [2004 NHL entry draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_NHL_entry_draft \"2004 NHL entry draft\") ( [Alexander Ovechkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ovechkin \"Alexander Ovechkin\")), which went to the Washington Capitals. However, Ovechkin's countryman, center [Evgeni Malkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeni_Malkin \"Evgeni Malkin\"), was similarly highly regarded, and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick. However, a transfer dispute between the NHL and the [International Ice Hockey Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ice_Hockey_Federation \"International Ice Hockey Federation\") (IIHF) delayed his Pittsburgh debut.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-Malkindraft-22)\n\nBy this point, the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cup-winning years of the early 1990s. Their home venue, the Civic Arena, had become the oldest arena in the NHL, and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility. With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins, Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling or relocating the team to [Kansas City, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri \"Kansas City, Missouri\").[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-23)[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-24)[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-25)[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-26) A [lockout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_NHL_lockout \"2004–05 NHL lockout\") prompted the cancellation of the [2004–05 NHL season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_NHL_season \"2004–05 NHL season\"). One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements on resolving the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins and the [Ottawa Senators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators \"Ottawa Senators\"), which had filed for bankruptcy protection.[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-27) During the lockout, the Penguins' players dispersed between the club's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the [Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkes-Barre/Scranton_Penguins \"Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins\"), and to European leagues.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2016-6)\n\n### Crosby–Malkin era (2005–present)\n\n[![Photograph of Sydney Crosby getting ready to pass a puck](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/SidneyCrosby.jpg/250px-SidneyCrosby.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SidneyCrosby.jpg) [Sidney Crosby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Crosby \"Sidney Crosby\") during his [sophomore season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_NHL_season \"2006–07 NHL season\") with the Penguins. He was drafted first overall by the team in the [2005 draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_NHL_entry_draft \"2005 NHL entry draft\").\n\nWith the lockout resolved in 2005, the NHL organized an unprecedented draft lottery to set the [2005 NHL entry draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_NHL_entry_draft \"2005 NHL entry draft\") selection order. The draft lottery, which was held behind closed doors in a \"secure location\", resulted in the Penguins being awarded the first overall pick.[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-lottery-28)[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-29)[\\[30\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-30) [Quebec Major Junior Hockey League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Major_Junior_Hockey_League \"Quebec Major Junior Hockey League\") (QMJHL) superstar [Sidney Crosby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Crosby \"Sidney Crosby\") (who had been training with Lemieux over the summer)[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-lottery-28) was the consensus first overall pick, with many referring to the draft lottery process as \"The Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes\". The Penguins selected Crosby on July 30, 2005, with the top pick, instantly rekindling interest in hockey in Pittsburgh.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2010-11)\n\nThe Penguins began rebuilding the team under the salary cap. However, Evgeni Malkin, the Penguins' 2004 draft pick, could not report to Pittsburgh immediately because of a playing rights dispute with the [Russian Superleague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Superleague \"Russian Superleague\"). The addition of Crosby paid instant dividends, with attendance rising by approximately 4,000 per game on average in the 2005–06 season.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-attendance-19) However, Crosby's presence did not immediately translate into wins, as the team began the season with a long winless skid that resulted in a head coaching change from Olczyk to [Michel Therrien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Therrien \"Michel Therrien\"). Then, on January 24, 2006, Lemieux announced his second retirement, after developing an [irregular heartbeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation \"Atrial fibrillation\"), this time permanently. He finished as the NHL's seventh all-time scorer (1,723), eighth in goals (690) and tenth in assists (1,033), and with the second-highest career points per game average (1.88), which is second to [Wayne Gretzky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky \"Wayne Gretzky\")'s 1.92.[\\[31\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-31)[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-32)\n\nDespite the team's struggles, Crosby established himself as a star in the league, amassing 102 points in his debut season and finishing second to Alexander Ovechkin for the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded each year to the league's top rookie. In the Penguins' final game of the season, Crosby tallied a goal and an assist to become the top-scoring rookie in Penguin history (eclipsing Lemieux). The Penguins again posted the worst record in the Eastern Conference and the highest goals-against total in the League. They received the second overall draft pick, their fourth top-two pick in four years, in the [2006 NHL entry draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_NHL_entry_draft \"2006 NHL entry draft\"), and selected touted two-way forward [Jordan Staal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Staal \"Jordan Staal\"). The team announced on April 20 they would not renew the contract for general manager [Craig Patrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Patrick \"Craig Patrick\"), who had been the general manager since December 1989.[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-33) On May 25, [Ray Shero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Shero \"Ray Shero\") signed a five-year contract as general manager.\n\n#### Resurgence and third Stanley Cup title (2006–2010)\n\n[![Photograph of Evgeni Malkin holding a hockey stick on the ice](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Evgeni_Malkin_%285364851150%29.jpg/250px-Evgeni_Malkin_%285364851150%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Evgeni_Malkin_(5364851150).jpg) [Evgeni Malkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeni_Malkin \"Evgeni Malkin\") made an immediate impact, driving the Penguins to their first playoff appearance in six years.\n\nChange came for the Penguins on October 18, 2006, when Evgeni Malkin made his NHL debut. He set the modern NHL record with a goal in each of his first six games. Malkin would record points in 16 consecutive games.[\\[34\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-34) The Penguins finished the [2006–07 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_NHL_season \"2006–07 NHL season\") in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 47–24–11, totaling 105 points, only two points behind the Atlantic Division winners, the New Jersey Devils. It was the franchise's first 100-point season in 11 years and represented an enormous 47-point leap from the previous season. In the first round of the [2007 playoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Stanley_Cup_playoffs \"2007 Stanley Cup playoffs\") the eventual Stanley Cup runners-up, the Ottawa Senators, defeated the Penguins 4–1. At the season's end, rookies Malkin and Jordan Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the Rookie of the Year, which Malkin won.\n\nOn March 13, 2007, Pennsylvania's governor [Ed Rendell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Rendell \"Ed Rendell\"), [Allegheny County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania \"Allegheny County, Pennsylvania\") chief executive [Dan Onorato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Onorato \"Dan Onorato\"), Pittsburgh's mayor [Luke Ravenstahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Ravenstahl \"Luke Ravenstahl\") and Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long-sought arena. The completion of [Consol Energy Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena \"PPG Paints Arena\") guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325 million [bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance) \"Bond (finance)\") was issued, and the Penguins signed a 30-year [lease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lease \"Lease\") on September 19, binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040.[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-35)\n\nAfter a mediocre start to the [2007–08 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_NHL_season \"2007–08 NHL season\"), Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin. On April 2, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title – their first division title in 10 years – with a 4–2 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the [Hart Memorial Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_Memorial_Trophy \"Hart Memorial Trophy\"). The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4–0, defeating the New York Rangers 4–1 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4–1 to clinch the [Prince of Wales Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales_Trophy \"Prince of Wales Trophy\"). Pittsburgh lost the [2008 Stanley Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Stanley_Cup_Final \"2008 Stanley Cup Final\") to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14–6 record.

The Penguins defeated the [Detroit Red Wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings \"Detroit Red Wings\") in series, earning their third Stanley Cup title.\n\nIn the [2008–09 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_NHL_season \"2008–09 NHL season\"), Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after [Dan Bylsma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Bylsma \"Dan Bylsma\") replaced head coach Therrien. The effect was almost instantaneous, and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington, sending them to the conference finals, where they eliminated the [Carolina Hurricanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes \"Carolina Hurricanes\") in a four-game sweep. After defeating the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the [Stanley Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Stanley_Cup_Final \"2009 Stanley Cup Final\") against the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they lost the previous year. After losing games 1 and 2 in [Detroit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit \"Detroit\"), like the previous years, the Penguins won games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team won on home ice in games 5 and 6. In game 7 in Detroit, [Maxime Talbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxime_Talbot \"Maxime Talbot\") scored two goals, including the game-winner, as the Penguins won 2–1 to win their third Stanley Cup title.[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-36) Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2010-11)\n\nDuring the [2009–10 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_NHL_season \"2009–10 NHL season\"), Crosby scored 109 points (51 goals and 58 assists) in 81 games, winning the [Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_%22Rocket%22_Richard_Trophy \"Maurice \\\"Rocket\\\" Richard Trophy\") as the NHL season's leading goalscorer. The Penguins, seeded fourth in the East, began their title defense, defeating the Ottawa Senators in six games. In the next round, the Penguins faced the Montreal Canadiens.

He finished with 50 goals and 109 points as the Penguins earned 51 wins on the season. With Malkin's Art Ross-winning performance, and Crosby's late-season return from injury, the Penguins headed into the [2012 playoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Stanley_Cup_playoffs \"2012 Stanley Cup playoffs\") with high hopes of making a significant Stanley Cup run. However, their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, defeated the highly favored Penguins in six games.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-40) Malkin was later awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy and [Lester B.

At the end of the regular season, they finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching up against the New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games, with Fleury struggling once again. The team then dispatched the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the conference finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game sweep. On June 13, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension worth an annual average of $9.5 million.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-43)\n\n[![Photograph of Phil Kessel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Phil_Kessel_2017-06-08.jpg/250px-Phil_Kessel_2017-06-08.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Phil_Kessel_2017-06-08.jpg) On July 1, 2015, the Penguins acquired right-winger [Phil Kessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Kessel \"Phil Kessel\") in a multi-player deal.\n\nIn the [2013–14 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_NHL_season \"2013–14 NHL season\"), the Penguins suffered numerous injuries throughout the campaign.

The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the [Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates_(NHL) \"Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)\") in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old [Pittsburgh Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Police \"Pittsburgh Police\") uniforms,[\\[83\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-83) beginning the black and gold color tradition in the city.[\\[82\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-uniform-82)\n\nThe Penguins generally wore the black and gold \"skating penguin\" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983–84 season.[\\[82\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-uniform-82)\n\nIn the [1992–93 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992%E2%80%9393_NHL_season \"1992–93 NHL season\"), the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the \"flying penguin\" logo, or \"Robopenguin\".[\\[84\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-vwa-84)[\\[85\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-85) The team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal \"Pittsburgh\" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second [alternate jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_jersey \"Third jersey\"), featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey proved to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the Penguins brought back the \"skating penguin\" logo, but with a \"Vegas gold\" shade, upon releasing its new alternate uniform. After 2002, the \"skating penguin\" was readopted as the primary, though the \"flying penguin\" remained the alternate. A corresponding white version of the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms was introduced, and the 1995–2002 black uniform was retired. When the new jerseys were unveiled for the 2007–08 season league wide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and removed the \"flying penguin\" logo from the shoulders.[\\[82\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-uniform-82)\n\n[![Photograph of Sidney Crosby and Chris Kunitz with Prince of Wales Trophy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/Sidney_Crosby_and_Chris_Kunitz_with_Prince_of_Wales_Trophy_2017-05-25_1.jpg/250px-Sidney_Crosby_and_Chris_Kunitz_with_Prince_of_Wales_Trophy_2017-05-25_1.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sidney_Crosby_and_Chris_Kunitz_with_Prince_of_Wales_Trophy_2017-05-25_1.jpg) Throughout the 2016–17 season, a commemorative patch was added to the uniforms to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary.\n\nThe Penguins have worn their black jersey at home since the league began the initiative to do so beginning with the [2003–04 NHL season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_NHL_season \"2003–04 NHL season\"). The team wore their powder blue, 1968–1972 \" [throwbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwback_uniform \"Throwback uniform\")\" against the Buffalo Sabres in the [2008 Winter Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_NHL_Winter_Classic \"2008 NHL Winter Classic\"). This throwback was supposedly retired with the introduction of a new dark blue third jersey that made its debut at the [2011 Winter Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_NHL_Winter_Classic \"2011 NHL Winter Classic\").[\\[86\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-86) For the 2011–12 season, the 2011 Winter Classic jersey was the team's official third uniform, with the 2008 Winter Classic uniform having been retired.[\\[87\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-87) Called the \"Blue Jerseys of Doom\" by the _[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Tribune-Review \"Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\")_, the alternate jerseys were worn when Sidney Crosby sustained a broken jaw and when he suffered a [concussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion \"Concussion\") in the 2011 Winter Classic. Evgeni Malkin was also concussed during a game when the Penguins donned the alternate uniforms.[\\[82\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-uniform-82)[\\[88\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-88)[\\[89\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-89)\n\nIn 2014, the Penguins released their new alternate uniforms. The new black uniforms are throwbacks to the early part of Lemieux's playing career, emulating the uniforms worn by the Penguins' 1991 and 1992 Cup-winning teams. The new alternate uniform featured \"Pittsburgh gold\", the particular shade of gold which had been retired when the Penguins switched to the metallic gold full-time in 2002.[\\[90\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-90) The Penguins eventually brought back a white version of the black \"Pittsburgh gold\" alternates, thus retiring the \"Vegas gold\" uniforms they wore from 2000 to 2016. A commemorative patch was added to the uniforms throughout the 2016–17 season to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary.[\\[91\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-91) During the [2017 Stadium Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_NHL_Stadium_Series \"2017 NHL Stadium Series\") against the [archrival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyers%E2%80%93Penguins_rivalry \"Flyers–Penguins rivalry\") Philadelphia Flyers, the Penguins wore a special gold uniform featuring military-inspired lettering, a \"City of Champions\" patch and a variation of the \"skating penguin\" logo.[\\[92\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-92) This design served as the basis for the team's third uniform, which was unveiled in the 2018–19 season and was also partly inspired by the early 1980s gold uniforms.[\\[93\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-93) The Penguins wore monochrome black uniforms minus the white elements when they faced the Flyers again in the [2019 Stadium Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_NHL_Stadium_Series \"2019 NHL Stadium Series\").[\\[94\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-94)\n\nIn 2021, the Penguins wore white \"Reverse Retro\" uniforms based on the 1992–97 uniforms. This set replaced the \"flying penguin\" with the alternate \"skating penguin\" logo minus the gold triangle on the shoulders.[\\[95\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-95) A black version served as the replacement for the gold alternate uniforms starting in the 2021–22 season.[\\[96\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-96) In the 2022–23 season, the Penguins unveiled their second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform, this time featuring a black version of the white \"flying penguin\" uniform they wore from 1992 to 2002.[\\[97\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-97)\n\nFor the [2023 Winter Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NHL_Winter_Classic \"2023 NHL Winter Classic\"), the Penguins went with a vintage white uniform with black stripes, and added a gold \"P\" logo as a nod to the NHL Pirates of the late 1920s.[\\[98\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-2023WC-98)\n\n### Arenas\n\nThe Penguins called Civic Arena home for over 45 seasons from their inception in 1967. In September 2010, they completed the move to [Consol Energy Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consol_Energy_Center \"Consol Energy Center\") (now named PPG Paints Arena). The Penguins also played two \"home\" games in the Cleveland suburb of [Richfield, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richfield,_Ohio \"Richfield, Ohio\"), in 1992 and 1993 at the [Richfield Coliseum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richfield_Coliseum \"Richfield Coliseum\") (this is not unlike the [Cleveland Cavaliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers \"Cleveland Cavaliers\") of the [NBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association \"National Basketball Association\") playing an annual pre-season game in Pittsburgh;[\\[99\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-99) the [Philadelphia 76ers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers \"Philadelphia 76ers\") used the Civic Arena as a second home in the early 1970s).[\\[100\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-100)\n\n[![See caption](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/UPMCLemieux.png/250px-UPMCLemieux.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UPMCLemieux.png) The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex under construction in [Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania \"Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania\"), in April 2015. The complex opened in August 2015, and is used by the Penguins as their practice facility.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2015, the [IceoPlex at Southpointe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceoPlex_at_Southpointe \"IceoPlex at Southpointe\") in the South Hills suburbs served as the team's practice facility. [Robert Morris University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_University \"Robert Morris University\")'s [84 Lumber Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/84_Lumber_Arena \"84 Lumber Arena\") has served as a secondary practice facility for the team. During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition games, the [Brantford Civic Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brantford_Civic_Centre \"Brantford Civic Centre\") in Brantford, Ontario, served as its home,[\\[101\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-101) and by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was using the suburban [Rostraver Ice Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostraver_Ice_Garden \"Rostraver Ice Garden\") for training.\n\nIn August 2015, the Penguins and the [University of Pittsburgh Medical Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh_Medical_Center \"University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\") (UPMC) opened the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, combining a new team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment and research complex, in suburban [Cranberry Township](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania \"Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania\") near the interchange between [Interstate 79](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_79 \"Interstate 79\") and [Pennsylvania Route 228](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Route_228 \"Pennsylvania Route 228\").[\\[102\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-LSM-102) The twin rink facility replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up Consol Energy Center for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play.[\\[103\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-103)\n\nAs with most other NHL arenas, the Penguins make use of a [goal horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_horn#Use_in_sports \"Air horn\") whenever the team scores a goal at home. It is also played just before the beginning of a home game, and after a Penguins victory. Their current goal horn made by [Nathan Manufacturing, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Manufacturing,_Inc. \"Nathan Manufacturing, Inc.\") and introduced in 2005 to coincide with Sidney Crosby joining the team, was used at both the Civic Arena and Consol Energy Center.[\\[104\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-104)[\\[105\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-105)\n\n### Minor league affiliates\n\nThe Penguins have two minor league affiliates assigned to their team. The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, their AHL affiliate, have played in [Wilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkes-Barre_Township,_Pennsylvania \"Wilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania\"), since 1999. The Penguins also have a secondary affiliate in the [ECHL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHL \"ECHL\"), the [Wheeling Nailers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeling_Nailers \"Wheeling Nailers\"), which they have been associated with since the start of the [2000–01 ECHL season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000%E2%80%9301_ECHL_season \"2000–01 ECHL season\").[\\[106\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-106)\n\n### Fanbase\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Iceburgh.jpg/250px-Iceburgh.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Iceburgh.jpg) Iceburgh, the mascot of the Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nDespite Pittsburgh's long history with hockey and a small but loyal fanbase, the Penguins struggled with fan support early on in its history, at times averaging only 6,000 fans per game when Civic Arena had a seating capacity of over 16,000. Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat.\n\nWhile the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical. [John Steigerwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steigerwald \"John Steigerwald\"), brother of former Penguins broadcaster [Paul Steigerwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Steigerwald \"Paul Steigerwald\"),[\\[107\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-107) noted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at [KDKA-TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDKA-TV \"KDKA-TV\") from [WTAE-TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTAE-TV \"WTAE-TV\") in 1985, the station cared more about the [Pittsburgh Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Spirit \"Pittsburgh Spirit\") of the [Major Indoor Soccer League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Indoor_Soccer_League_(1978%E2%80%9392) \"Major Indoor Soccer League (1978–92)\") than the Penguins.[\\[108\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-108) However, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade.\n\nToday, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three [major professional sports teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada \"Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada\"), taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field.[\\[109\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-109) Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of [Andrew McCutchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCutchen \"Andrew McCutchen\") and that team's turnaround)[\\[110\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-110) ranked much lower on the list than its peers.

rivalry\")\n\nConsidered by some to be the best [rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League_rivalries \"National Hockey League rivalries\") in the NHL,[\\[126\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-129)[\\[127\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-130)[\\[128\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-131) the Philadelphia Flyers–Pittsburgh Penguins rivalry began in 1967 when the teams were introduced in the NHL's \"Next Six\" expansion wave. The rivalry exists both due to divisional alignment and geographic location, as both teams play in [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\"). The Flyers lead the head-to-head record with a 153–98–30 record.[\\[129\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-132) However, the Penguins eliminated the Flyers from the playoffs in 2008 and 2009 and were eliminated by them from the playoffs in 2012, strengthening the rivalry. Three years later, the Flyers won the sixth playoff meeting between the clubs to advance to the conference semifinals.[\\[130\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-133)\n\nThe franchises have met seven times in the playoffs, with the Flyers winning four series (1989 division finals, 4–3; 1997 conference quarterfinals, 4–1; 2000 conference semifinals, 4–2; and 2012 conference quarterfinals, 4–2) and the Penguins winning three (2008 conference finals, 4–1; 2009 conference quarterfinals, 4–2; and 2018 first round, 4–2).\n\n### Washington Capitals\n\nMain article: [Capitals–Penguins rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitals%E2%80%93Penguins_rivalry \"Capitals–Penguins rivalry\")\n\n[![Photographs of an on-ice altercation between the Penguins and the Washington Capitals](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Caps-Pens-_Game_1_%282009_NHL_Playoffs%29_-_13_%283494716673%29.jpg/250px-Caps-Pens-_Game_1_%282009_NHL_Playoffs%29_-_13_%283494716673%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Caps-Pens-_Game_1_(2009_NHL_Playoffs)_-_13_(3494716673).jpg) An altercation between the Penguins and the [Washington Capitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals \"Washington Capitals\") during the [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Stanley_Cup_playoffs \"2009 Stanley Cup playoffs\") playoffs.\n\nThe two teams have faced off 11 times in the playoffs, with the Penguins winning nine of the 11 matchups, their two series losses coming in the 1994 and 2018 playoffs. The Penguins defeated the Capitals en route to their five Stanley Cup victories. They have met in a decisive game 7 in the 1992, 1995, 2009 and 2017 playoffs. The NHL's fourth [Winter Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Classic \"Winter Classic\"), played on January 1, 2011, at [Heinz Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Field \"Heinz Field\") in Pittsburgh showcased this rivalry. The Capitals won the game 3–1. The rivalry can also be seen in the American Hockey League (AHL). Pittsburgh's top farm team is the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and their in-state and biggest rivals are the Capitals' top farm team, the [Hershey Bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_Bears \"Hershey Bears\").[\\[131\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-134)[\\[132\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-135)[\\[133\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-136)\n\n## Media\n\n### Radio\n\nFurther information: [Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins_Radio_Network \"Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network\")\n\nThe Penguins have their radio home on [WXDX-FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WXDX-FM \"WXDX-FM\") and their television home on [SportsNet Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsNet_Pittsburgh \"SportsNet Pittsburgh\"). The [Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins_Radio_Network \"Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network\") consists of a total of 34 stations in four states.[\\[134\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-137) Twenty three of these are in Pennsylvania, four in West Virginia, three in Ohio, and three in Maryland. The network also features an FM high-definition station in Pittsburgh.\n\n### Broadcasters\n\nMain article: [List of Pittsburgh Penguins broadcasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pittsburgh_Penguins_broadcasters \"List of Pittsburgh Penguins broadcasters\")\n\nLocal ABC affiliate WTAE-TV broadcast the Penguins during the 1967–68 season, with station Sports Director [Ed Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Conway \"Ed Conway\") handling the play-by-play during both the television and radio broadcasts. He remained the lone play-by-play broadcaster until the completion of the 1968–69 season. Joe Tucker took over for Ed Conway during the 1969–70 season, when WPGH-TV and WTAE-TV split Penguins' broadcasts. WPGH-TV retained the rights to broadcast the Penguins for the 1970–71 season, with Bill Hamilton handing the play-by-play duties. The 1970–71 season was also the first season where the Penguins introduced a [color commentator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator \"Color commentator\") to the broadcast team, with John MacDonald taking the position in the booth.[\\[135\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-138)[\\[136\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-139)\n\n[![Photograph of Mike Lange](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Mike_Lange_1_2011-12-03.JPG/250px-Mike_Lange_1_2011-12-03.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mike_Lange_1_2011-12-03.JPG) [Mike Lange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lange \"Mike Lange\") served as a play-by-play commentator for the team from 1974 until 2021.\n\n[Mike Lange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lange \"Mike Lange\"), who joined the Penguins' broadcast team as a play-by-play announcer on the radio side in 1974–75 became the play-by-play broadcaster for the team at the start of the 1979–80 season. At his side was Terry Schiffauer, who had previously held the position of Penguins' director of public relations and eventually transitioned into color commentator for Sam Nover in 1972–73. Lange and Schiffauer remained a team in the Penguins' broadcast booth until 1984–85, when Schiffauer was replaced by Paul Steigerwald. Lange and Steigerwald remained a constant in the broadcast booth from 1985 until 1999.\nWith Steigerwald's departure in 1999, Mike Lange shared the broadcast booth with former Penguins' defenseman [Peter Taglianetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Taglianetti \"Peter Taglianetti\"). Taglianetti remained in the position for one season before being replaced by Eddie Olczyk. Lange and Olczyk were broadcast partners from 2000 until 2003, when Olczyk left the booth to become the 18th head coach in Penguins' history following the firing of previous head coach [Rick Kehoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Kehoe \"Rick Kehoe\") after the 2002–03 season.[\\[137\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-140) With Olczyk's vacancy, the Penguins hired [Bob Errey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Errey \"Bob Errey\") as their new color commentator for the start of the 2003–04 season. Lange and Errey remained in the booth until 2005–06. After 26 seasons in the television broadcast booth, FSN Pittsburgh did not retain Mike Lange. Instead, he was replaced by former broadcast partner Paul Steigerwald, who remained the team's TV play-by-play broadcaster until the 2016–17 season. Lange returned to the radio broadcast booth and holds the position of radio play-by-play announcer, the same position he held with the team in the mid-1970s. Following the 2016–17 season, Steigerwald moved back to the Penguins front office and [NHL Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Network_(American_TV_channel) \"NHL Network (American TV channel)\") personality [Steve Mears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mears \"Steve Mears\") was hired as the new television play-by-play announcer starting with the 2017–18 season. Lange retired in the 2021 off-season, with Josh Getzoff being named as his replacement. [Phil Bourque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Bourque \"Phil Bourque\") serves as the radio color commentator. Before the 2023–24 season, Getzoff moved to the television booth with Mears replacing him on the radio.[\\[138\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-141)[\\[139\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-142) The Penguins did not retain TV analyst Bob Errey, choosing to go with a rotation of analysts featuring former Penguins [Colby Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_Armstrong \"Colby Armstrong\"), [Mike Rupp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rupp \"Mike Rupp\") and Phil Bourque.[\\[140\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-143)[\\[141\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-144) In 2024, Joe Brand replaced Steve Mears on the radio booth after Mears was hired by the Blue Jackets.[\\[142\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-145)\n\nEvery Penguins game is carried on the AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh network, which is carried by cable providers in most of two states and parts of four others. On October 2, 2023, the network will be purchased by the Penguins and rebranded to [SportsNet Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsNet_Pittsburgh \"SportsNet Pittsburgh\").[\\[143\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-146) In addition, [Fox Sports Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_Ohio \"Fox Sports Ohio\") simulcasts Penguins hockey in the [Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland \"Cleveland\") metro area, as well as some parts of Eastern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. Dish Network, Verizon FiOS, and Direct TV each carry the Penguins games on their AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh channel in HD nationally. The Pittsburgh Penguins also receive monthly and sometimes weekly \"game of the week\" national exposure on American networks [ESPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN \"ESPN\"), [ESPN+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN%2B \"ESPN+\"), [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company \"American Broadcasting Company\"), and [TNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network) \"TNT (American TV network)\"), and Canadian networks [Sportsnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsnet \"Sportsnet\") and [CBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_Television \"CBC Television\").
