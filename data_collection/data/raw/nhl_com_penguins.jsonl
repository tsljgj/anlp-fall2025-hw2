{"url": "https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/youth-movement-shapes-penguins-roster-decisions", "title": "Youth Movement Shapes Penguins’ Roster Decisions | Pittsburgh Penguins", "content": "# Youth Movement Shapes Penguins’ Roster Decisions\n\nByMichelle Crechiolo\n\nPenguins Team Reporter\n\nOctober 04, 2025\n\n- Link copied\n\nKyle Dubas was crystal clear about his expectations for this year’s training camp. First and foremost, the Penguins wanted their younger players to push.\n\n“If they continue to push all the way, and it's very clear that they should be on the team, then they'll make the team,” Pittsburgh’s President of Hockey Operations and GM said. “We'll deal with whatever the ripple effects of those are on some of the more veteran guys.”\n\nIt made for an interesting preseason as we saw how everyone responded.\n\n“That gets the most out of everybody,\" Rickard Rakell said. \"Because all the young guys who are coming in and fighting for a spot kind of reminds all of us what we were at that age. Like, you're fearless. What do you have to lose? That's the kind of mindset that you want. You don't think too much, you just go out there and try to play your game. I think if everybody has that mindset, you push each other to be better.\"\n\nIt resulted in some extremely difficult decisions for management and the coaching staff, and left the Penguins with 23 healthy players on the roster as of Saturday ahead of the first game of the season on Tuesday against the Rangers – including Ben Kindel (18) and Harrison Brunicke (19).\n\nThe last time Pittsburgh had two teenagers on their opening-night roster was back in the 2006-07 season, with Jordan Staal and Kris Letang.\n\n“It’s fun to see those young guys earn a spot and have a chance to show what they can do at this level,” Letang said. “It’s exciting stuff. It’s always good to have new blood.”\n\nThere is still time before the opening-night roster has to be submitted, so we won’t do a full analysis just yet, in case anything changes. Instead, we’ll break down the key moves from Saturday.\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlaySkip BackwardSkip Forward\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 0:00\n\nLoaded: 0%\n\n0:00\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently behind liveLIVE\n\nRemaining Time -0:00\n\n1x\n\nPlayback Rate\n\nChapters\n\n- Chapters\n\nDescriptions\n\n- descriptions off, selected\n\nCaptions\n\n- captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n- captions off, selected\n\nAudio Track\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

And so, we get to today, this is where we're at.”\n\nKindel appeared in all but one of the exhibition contests, picking up a goal and two assists, while displaying the parts of his game that got him drafted 11th overall by Pittsburgh: hockey sense and intelligence. There were a couple of other assets that stood out to the Penguins captain.\n\n“I think he's got a lot of poise with the puck, a lot of speed,” Sidney Crosby said. “Those two things probably stand out the most. I think he's using his speed well. He's finding guys, he distributes the puck really well, and he seems like he's confident. It doesn't seem like it's been too fast for him or anything like that. To this point, he's done a great job. So, sometimes it takes time to adjust all that. It seems like with every game, he's getting more and more comfortable.”\n\nKindel said he just tried to control what he could, and bring a certain level of consistency to the rink each day with his work ethic and compete level. That’s what has allowed him to thrive.\n\n“Just kind of showed up every day, tried to get better each day, and just show what I can do each day,” Kindel said. “I'm really grateful to still be here, have this opportunity to continue and be in this environment. I’ve learned a lot, grown a lot. Just got to see what it kind of takes to live this life. Going through training camp and preseason, just how they have to take every day, work hard, preparation, all those things. You have to do it with a pro mindset.”\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlaySkip BackwardSkip Forward\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 0:00\n\nLoaded: 0%\n\n0:00\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently behind liveLIVE\n\nRemaining Time -0:00\n\n1x\n\nPlayback Rate\n\nChapters\n\n- Chapters\n\nDescriptions\n\n- descriptions off, selected\n\nCaptions\n\n- captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n- captions off, selected\n\nAudio Track\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

It’s feeling good.”\n\nAfter being drafted in the second round (45th overall) of the 2024 NHL Draft, Brunicke played in four exhibition games before returning to his junior team, as the Penguins felt that would be best for his development. Brunicke ended up making his professional debut with WBS at the end of the year and overall, his game really came along.\n\nBoth Dubas and Penguins assistant GM Jason Spezza said they expected Brunicke to “make some noise” in training camp, and he did. Like Kindel, Brunicke has a healthy amount of confidence, which is what stands out to Letang.\n\n“He's got tons of confidence with the puck,” Letang said. “He has a pretty good set of skills, whether it's skating, puck handling. Obviously, his confidence makes him really dangerous. He can hold onto pucks and use his patience. So, it’s going to be exciting to see what he can do at this level.”\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlaySkip BackwardSkip Forward\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 0:00\n\nLoaded: 0%\n\n0:00\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently behind liveLIVE\n\nRemaining Time -0:00\n\n1x\n\nPlayback Rate\n\nChapters\n\n- Chapters\n\nDescriptions\n\n- descriptions off, selected\n\nCaptions\n\n- captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n- captions off, selected\n\nAudio Track\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

Pickering, Pittsburgh's 2022 first-round pick, made his NHL debut last year. The consensus was that Broz would have done the same if a case of mono hadn’t derailed him. Hayes wasn’t eligible last year, as he was on an AHL-only deal. But the organization signed him to an NHL contract in the spring, and the Penguins think very highly of the forward, as do all of his teammates.\n\nThere is a ton of excitement surrounding Murashov, [who put together a tremendous first pro season in North America](https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/murashov-wins-10th-straight-setting-wbs-rookie-record), and had a strong showing throughout the preseason. “He had a really good camp. _Really_ good camp,” Muse said. “I think he has an extremely, extremely bright future.\n\n“I think with somebody his age, you have to factor (his long-term development) in, especially when it comes to the goaltending position. You do. There's a history of that. The league as a whole, when you look at the guys that have risen to the highest level of goaltending in the NHL, you can look at the time that was spent there in the American League.”\n\nMuse also made a great point: making the opening-night roster isn’t the only way to measure success.\n\n“I think even for some of the players that we're not moving forward with currently, they did earn things, even though they might not be as apparent as the ones that are still here,” he said. “And so, I think right now, that's a decision that was made, and we think that it’s the best for right now.”\n\n## **RIPPLE EFFECTS**\n\nAlexander Alexeyev, Ryan Graves, Rafael Harvey-Pinard, Boko Imama and Sam Poulin were placed on waivers and will be assigned to WBS pending clearance, while Robby Fabbri was released from his PTO. Danton Heinen cleared waivers on Friday.\n\nGrave’s contract status makes him the most eye-opening name of that group. The 30-year-old defenseman is entering the third season of a six-year contract with an average annual value of $4.5 million.\n\n“Obviously, it was a very tough decision. It's not one that anybody takes lightly,” Muse said. “It's a lot of conversations, a lot of thought.”\n\nThat process was something Muse and his staff expected considering all of the work management did over the summer to retool the blue line, an area of concern last season. Remaining in Pittsburgh at this point are Erik Karlsson, Kris Letang, Ryan Shea, Parker Wotherspoon, Caleb Jones, Connor Clifron, Matt Dumba, and Brunicke.\n\n“It was competitive, and we just felt like the eight that are with us as of today, was the group that we felt best suited moving forward,” Muse said. “And part of it is also on those other guys too, and the work that they put in to make it a very, very difficult decision.”\n\n### Musings: Penguins 5, Sabres 4 OT (Preseason Finale)\n\nOct 03, 2025\n\n### Healthy Novak Looking to Carve Out Role with Penguins\n\nOct 03, 2025\n\n### Penguins Preseason Lineup Versus Sabres (10.03.25)\n\nOct 02, 2025\n\n### Penguins Trim Training Camp Roster\n\nOct 02, 2025\n\n### Musings: Penguins 5, Sabres 3 (Preseason Game 6)\n\nOct 01, 2025\n\n### Penguins Preseason Lineup Versus Sabres (10.01.25)\n\nSep 30, 2025\n\n### Assistant Coach Spotlight: Rich Clune\n\nSep 30, 2025\n\n### Building Brick by Brick: Kindel Earning Opportunities\n\nSep 29, 2025\n\n### Penguins, F.N.B.

{"url": "https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/healthy-novak-looking-to-carve-out-role-with-penguins", "title": "Healthy Novak Looking to Carve Out Role with Penguins | Pittsburgh Penguins", "content": "# Healthy Novak Looking to Carve Out Role with Penguins\n\nByMichelle Crechiolo\n\nPenguins Team Reporter\n\nOctober 03, 2025\n\n- Link copied\n\nDan Muse and Tommy Novak actually go way back, to the forward’s days playing high school hockey at St. Thomas Academy in Minnesota.\n\n“There was a year with USA Hockey, at the summer festivals, I had actually coached him one summer for a week when he was young,” Muse recalled with a laugh.\n\nAt the time, Muse - [named Pittsburgh's head coach in June](https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/character-passion-and-dedication-define-dan-muse-s-path-to-pittsburgh) \\- was on Yale’s coaching staff.\n\n“At that time, it was just cool, college coaches were around us and stuff,” Novak said. “So, I remember him, like, oh, the Yale coach is here. So, I vaguely remember that. I also remember he had a distinct voice on him. So, I remember him fairly well from those days, which is kind of funny.”\n\nMuse said the throughline of Novak’s game from then to now is hockey sense, ability to read plays, and versatility.\n\n“He's a player that I don't think there's any kind of a panic threshold,” Muse said. “There’s just great poise when he has the puck, and he can make things happen in tight spaces. He's got a great defensive stick. He puts himself in good positions there defensively and is in a position there not just on offense, but also on defense, be able to be really dangerous in transition.”\n\nThose are big reasons the Penguins acquired Novak from Nashville at last year’s trade deadline, along with his overall ability to create offense, which he called his strongest asset. Before coming to Pittsburgh, Novak recorded 49 goals, 68 assists and 117 points in 201 career games with Nashville after debuting in 2021. He set career highs in goals (18), assists (27) and points (45) in 2023-24.\n\nThe original plan, said Penguins President of Hockey Operations and GM Kyle Dubas, was to play Novak with Evgeni Malkin. Unfortunately, Novak got injured after playing just two games in black and gold, and missed the remainder of the season.\n\n“It was a bit of a whirlwind, finding out I got traded and then I joined the team on the road, and I ended up being hurt by the time we came back to Pittsburgh,” Novak said. “It was a little bit frustrating, for sure, just wanting to get off to a good start with the organization. This summer was a good time for me to reset and get ready.”\n\nVideo Player is loading.\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlaySkip BackwardSkip Forward\n\nMute\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\n/\n\nDuration 0:00\n\nLoaded: 0%\n\n0:00\n\nStream Type LIVE\n\nSeek to live, currently behind liveLIVE\n\nRemaining Time -0:00\n\n1x\n\nPlayback Rate\n\nChapters\n\n- Chapters\n\nDescriptions\n\n- descriptions off, selected\n\nCaptions\n\n- captions settings, opens captions settings dialog\n- captions off, selected\n\nAudio Track\n\nFullscreen\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nBeginning of dialog window.

He’s a Golden Retriever puppy, he’s four and a half months now. Taking care of him, got him in July. So yeah, that was the big thing this summer, for sure.”\n\nGoing into the final game of the preseason, Novak had picked up a goal and an assist in three appearances. While he feels okay, there is still work to do.\n\n“I think I'm just getting my legs under me every game a little bit more,” Novak said. “I think it can be hard, just haven’t played hockey in quite a while with the injury last year. So, I think it's getting better every game. I'm trying to just put a full 60 together. And yeah, I think there's been progress. So, I think it's on the uptrend.”\n\nHis mindset for this season overall is continuing to work on his overall game, carve out a role and keep pushing forward.\n\n“I have had stretches in this league where I’ve been really good and maybe had some stretches where it’s not gone my way,” Novak said. “But I’ll just try to stay consistent every day and try to carve out a role where they can rely on me and I can be here for a while.”\n\n### Youth Movement Shapes Penguins’ Roster Decisions\n\nOct 04, 2025\n\n### Musings: Penguins 5, Sabres 4 OT (Preseason Finale)\n\nOct 03, 2025\n\n### Penguins Preseason Lineup Versus Sabres (10.03.25)\n\nOct 02, 2025\n\n### Penguins Trim Training Camp Roster\n\nOct 02, 2025\n\n### Musings: Penguins 5, Sabres 3 (Preseason Game 6)\n\nOct 01, 2025\n\n### Penguins Preseason Lineup Versus Sabres (10.01.25)\n\nSep 30, 2025\n\n### Assistant Coach Spotlight: Rich Clune\n\nSep 30, 2025\n\n### Building Brick by Brick: Kindel Earning Opportunities\n\nSep 29, 2025\n\n### Penguins, F.N.B.

It's not just about towering skyscrapers or massive bridges. Steel has been the backbone of our past and it’s essential to a sustainable future. At U. S. Steel, we are building the future of steel and we're building it one innovation at a time.\n\nWe recently turned two diesel locomotives at our Mon Valley Works into eco-friendly, battery-powered machines. The locomotives, which travel within the facilities carrying steel, coke, scrap metal, iron ore, and other materials necessary for production, are expected to reduce airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions by .385 tons - the equivalent emissions of 7,000 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles.\n\nAs we march towards our goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, every step counts. Environmental stewardship isn't just a fancy term for us. It's at the core of everything we do, embedded deep in our S.T.E.E.L. Principles. We're talking about a serious commitment to safeguarding our natural resources. After all, our communities, our ecosystems, and heck, our entire planet's future depends on it.\n\n[![Indra Energy Penguins Pledge Partner and Champion Sustainability Partner](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_ratio16_9-size30/f_auto/prd/wq3rkevxqxuhrejrzl38.jpg)](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231024963904/en/Indra-Energy-and-Pittsburgh-Penguins-Bring-Sustainability-to-the-Forefront-with-Renewed-Partnership \"Learn More\")\n\n[**Indra Energy Penguins Pledge Partner and Champion Sustainability Partner**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231024963904/en/Indra-Energy-and-Pittsburgh-Penguins-Bring-Sustainability-to-the-Forefront-with-Renewed-Partnership \"Learn More\")\n\nIndra Energy is committed to promoting earth-friendly energy and green causes.

{"url": "https://www.nhl.com/penguins/news/musings-penguins-5-sabres-4-ot-preseason-finale", "title": "Musings: Penguins 5, Sabres 4 OT (Preseason Finale) | Pittsburgh Penguins", "content": "# Musings: Penguins 5, Sabres 4 OT (Preseason Finale)\n\nByBrandon Karafilis\n\nPittsburgh Penguins\n\nOctober 03, 2025\n\n- Link copied\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins ended their preseason on a high note, earning their fifth straight win after defeating the Buffalo Sabres 5-4 in overtime. Sidney Crosby scored late in the third period to tie the game and then got the game-winner just nine seconds into the extra frame.\n\nEven without the help of forward Bryan Rust, who is out with a lower-body injury, Pittsburgh’s power play was able to score two goals that brought them back into the game.\n\n“We could easily have gotten frustrated not getting in on the first few breakouts, but I think we just stuck with it and tried to keep attacking the net and looked for rebounds, looked for the next play,” said Rickard Rakell, who scored the first power-play goal. “It was nice to get us back in the game.”\n\nWhile Crosby and Rakell only suited up for two games during the preseason, they each recorded three goals, amping up for opening night on Oct. 7 against the New York Rangers.\n\n“I feel ready to go,” Rakell said. “I'm excited for the season, and I'm excited for our room and our team, and yeah – I think everybody wants to be a better version of themselves from last year. So, it's the same mindset.”\n\nAfter trailing 3-1 midway through the game, Head Coach Dan Muse called a timeout to get his group refocused. While it was still just a preseason game, these are valuable moments to learn from and take into the regular season.\n\n“Some people, I think, don't put in a lot of stock \\[in the preseason\\],” said Muse. “I think they're important. And I think tonight, in the third period, the players played like it was important. But now, you've been in a situation early in the season where you know that, all right, you can be down by a couple of goals and it's far from over. We want to play with a never-out-of-it mindset all the time. Credit to them. They came out and they played, and it was great to see them get the job done.”\n\nAnd now, there are some difficult personnel decisions to make ahead of Tuesday.\n\n“There’s going to be a lot of conversations here, starting tonight, with Kyle (Dubas) and management. There’s still some hard decisions to make,” Muse said. “Those decisions are going to need to be made and conversations are going to need to be had. We’re going to prepare.”\n\nHere is the lineup Pittsburgh drew up for their preseason finale:\n\nRickard Rakell – Sidney Crosby – Ville Koivunen\n\nAnthony Mantha – Evgeni Malkin – Justin Brazeau\n\nTommy Novak – Ben Kindel – Phil Tomasino\n\nConnor Dewar – Noel Acciari – Filip Hallander\n\nParker Wotherspoon – Erik Karlsson\n\nCaleb Jones – Kris Letang\n\nConnor Clifton – Harrison Brunicke\n\nTristan Jarry and Sergei Murashov split the game in net.\n\n\\*After coming to Pittsburgh in a trade from Nashville back in November 2024, Phil Tomasino was able to find his groove, with six of his 11 goals being game winners. Now entering his first full season with the Penguins, the former 2019 first-round pick has benefited from an entire training camp and preseason with the team.\n\n“It feels great to get the chance to be here for the last few months of last year, and get familiar with everyone, the city, and everyone involved in the organization,” Tomasino said. “But overall, it’s been really good and we’re getting better every day here.”\n\nAnd getting better every day is precisely what the winger has accomplished when he finished the preseason off strong with five points (2G-3A) in the five games he was in the lineup for.\n\nEarlier this summer, Tomasino re-signed with the team on a one-year contract.\n\n“There's no other place I'd rather be than here, I love it here,” he said. “I'm just grateful for that opportunity. And I'm ready to show that I can help this team night in and night out.”\n\n\\*This time last year, Harrison Brunicke came extremely close to making the team’s opening night roster as an 18-year-old after being selected in the second round of the NHL Draft.\n\nNow, in the present day, Brunicke has found himself in a similar situation, this time with a lot more growth.\n\n“I think just overall it’s been my whole game,” said Brunicke on the changes he’s noticed compared from last season to now. “I’m kind of changing that into more of a pro style instead of taking more risks or holding onto the puck too long, things like that. It’s really just playing more of a pro game, keeping it more simple, and taking opportunities when I can.”\n\nBrunicke’s offensive awareness and puck skills came into full effect on Friday’s game against Buffalo. The smooth-skating defenseman scored an impressive goal that had little-to-no angle to get the puck under the bar and past Sabres goaltender Alex Lyon.\n\n“I just got some time on the blue line,” said Brunicke on his goal. “I made a play down low and luckily enough I saw some space, and it went in.”\n\nAt just 19 years old, Brunicke has shown the ability to form his game at an NHL-caliber level with each passing day.\n\n“From the start, each day I just came in here with an open mindset of just wanting to get better,” Brunicke said. “You look around the room at all these great players, and it’s so cool to learn from them and see the work they put in and just kind of feed off that.”\n\n\\*When attending training camp last season, Sergei Murashov did not see any preseason action. The 2022 fourth-round pick made the most of his appearances this season, posting a .932 save percentage in the three appearances he made.\n\nWhile Murashov’s play has been impressive, what stands out to Muse is the work ethic, as the 21-year-old goalie has been the last one off the ice after practices.\n\n\"He’s obviously had a very strong camp, and he’s young,” Muse said. “It’s good to see a young player like that who’s pushing as hard as he is, who’s as competitive as he is, and dedicated as he is.\"\n\nAfter coming to North America last season, Murashov dominated at both the AHL and ECHL levels, saying all of that experience helped him a lot.\n\n“I would say the main thing is the work, it paid off,” said Murashov on his biggest takeaway from training camp. “It’s a very enjoyable time. Even if it’s a hard process. Guys are working hard. They challenge you every day. You have to respond. That’s really nice to be (a part of) always.”\n\nPresident of Hockey Operations and GM Kyle Dubas said at the start of training camp that ultimately, the two best goaltenders will make the team come opening night, regardless of contract status. While time will tell how things unfold going into the first game, Murashov is proud of the work he has put in and will continue to put his best foot forward.\n\n“I just did my job.

Learn to Play changes the way youth hockey is offered by providing an all-inclusive program for first-time participants:  head-to-toe equipment, eight (8) to ten (10) weeks of age appropriate on-ice instruction, and certified coaching in a fun and safe atmosphere.\n\nremoveaddHow much does the Little Penguins Learn to Play Program cost?\n\nThe participation fee varies by facility, but ranges between $249 and $299, plus processing fees.\n\nremoveaddWhat are the eligibility requirements for the Little Penguins Learn to Play Program?\n\nThe Little Penguins Learn to Play program is offered to new, first-time participants (boys and girls), between the ages of five (5) and nine (9). First-time participants are those who have not been previously participated in a hockey league/program (house/rec league, learn to play, mini-mites, camps, etc.) or registered with USA Hockey. It is strongly recommended that participants complete a Learn to Skate session at their local ice rink prior to enrolling in Little Penguins.\n\n_\\*If the host facility becomes aware that a registered child has previous hockey league/program experience, the child will be removed from the Little Penguins program and the parent/guardian(s) will not be refunded._\n\nremoveaddDoes my child need to know how to skate before they sign up for Little Penguins?\n\nIt is **strongly** recommended that children complete a \"Learn to Skate\" session through their local ice rink prior to enrolling in Little Penguins. In addition, most rinks have regular public ice skating sessions which are a great way to gain experience and confidence on the ice. For those looking to register for a \"Learn to Skate\" program, please contact your local ice rink.\n\nremoveaddWhere will Little Penguins Learn to Play be offered?\n\nThe Little Penguins Learn to Play program is offered at over twenty local ice rinks throughout the Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio and West Virginia region. Although, not every ice rink hosts during each session (Fall, Winter and Spring). A list of locations hosting during the current/upcoming session, can be found after clicking the “Register Now!” button above, under the \"Open Registrations\" section. A list of all our host locations, can be found below “Open Registrations” in the \"Rink and Address Locations\" section.\n\n## Registration\n\nremoveaddI registered my child for the Little Penguins program, but my child is no longer able to participate. Can I cancel the registration?\n\nWe understand that things change and ask that you contact us as soon as possible with any refund requests. Please understand the Little Penguins Learn to Play program cannot offer refunds for participants that: do not meet the program eligibility requirements; register for multiple locations/sessions; or cancel after the registrant’s equipment is kitted and/or picked up. This policy is in place because once registration fees are collected, preparations for an individuals participation begin quickly by the Penguins as well as host sites to kit equipment, plan ice time/coaches and other fixed costs. All of which are expenses that cannot be recouped if a registrant cancels in the above instances. We care about your customer experience and will work to accommodate each request individually. Please email [littlepenguins@pittsburghpenguins.com](mailto:littlepenguins@pittsburghpenguins.com) with any cancellation questions.\n\nremoveaddI want to register my child at our local rink, but the Little Penguins sessions are full. What do I do?\n\nWe have waitlists for all Little Penguins programs. If you are interested in a session that is full, please register for the waitlist. We will do our best to contact participants on the waitlist to move them onto a roster should a spot become available.\n\nremoveaddI have two children. Will they be in the same session?\n\nIf you successfully registered your children for the same session, then yes. All participants will be on the ice at the same time. Coaches may split the class into groups for drills throughout the program.\n\nremoveaddWhat is USA Hockey and why is my child registered with them?\n\nUSA Hockey is the national governing body of ice hockey in the United States ( [https://www.usahockey.com/](https://www.usahockey.com/)). USA Hockey provides a number of resources for the Learn to Play program, including; age-appropriate training modules and practice plans, coaching certification, background screening and insurance for all Learn to Play participants. Each Little Penguins participant receives a free USA Hockey player membership for the season in which they complete the program.

Please be aware that it can take longer than expected to get your child dressed, especially before the first few sessions.\n\nremoveaddMy child cannot make one of the classes. What should we do?\n\nPlease make sure to let your Coach know that you will not be attending a certain class.\n\n## Equipment\n\nremoveaddWhat equipment is provided or required for the Little Penguins program?\n\nUpon registration, each participant will receive head-to-toe equipment. The equipment provided includes: a helmet (with a cage), neck guard, shoulder pads, elbow pads, gloves, hockey pants, shin guards, skates, jersey, hockey socks, a hockey stick and an equipment bag.

The children spent a day at a Penguins practice, took part in their individual photo sessions, had lunch with the team and finished their visit with a meet & greet in the locker room.\n\nThe three portraits will be unveiled at the Penguins’ Hockey Fights Cancer game on November 19.\n\n[![Movember](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_ratio16_9-size30/f_auto/prd/rovkrdc1p2qj5ogcml7r.jpg)](https://us.movember.com/team/2349586 \"Donate Now\")\n\n[**Movember**](https://us.movember.com/team/2349586 \"Donate Now\")\n\nPenguins players raised funds and awareness for men's health during the NHL's annual Movember campaign by growing out some wicked mustaches.\n\n- [Donate Now](https://us.movember.com/team/2349586 \"Donate Now\")\n\n## Early Detection Saves Lives\n\nSome cancers can develop without symptoms, only showing symptoms after they've grown and spread. That is why cancer screenings are so important. Routine cancer screenings play a vital role in early detection, prevention, and treatment of cancer.\n\n- [More Info](https://hillman.upmc.com/patients/early-detection/screenings \"\")\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins are proud to support the league-wide Hockey Fights Cancer (HFC) program.\n\nThe Penguins will hold HFC Night on Tuesday, November 19 when the Pens take on the Tampa Bay Lightning at 7:00 PM. The game is part of a league-wide program to raise awareness and funds for the NHL’s Hockey Fights Cancer initiative.\n\nAutographed memorabilia will be available for bid through an online auction held by the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation from November 19 at 12:00 PM through November 25 at 12:00 PM. Mystery autographed pucks signed by Penguins players and warmup pucks used during the pregame skate will also be available for purchase behind Section 104.\n\nAll proceeds from the Penguins’ HFC fundraising will benefit cancer programs at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.\n\nA variety of tables hosted by local cancer-related organizations will be on the concourse to distribute information.\n\n## **Wallpapers**\n\n[![](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_w_720/f_png/prd/stpojniw2l8yionjsxf8.png)](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/prd/u9ko9xlptk3ztxsscpvy)\n\n[![](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_w_720/f_auto/prd/seg9naadlyrlzjdreqvt.jpg)](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/prd/oz2mwhz409mqfjltlana)\n\n[![](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_w_720/f_auto/prd/vehnel4jmjrcyhr8rkak.jpg)](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/prd/mikosyipn7zvzzyamc8u)\n\nFounding Partners\n\n[![PPG](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/v1693245178/prd/assets/penguins/assets/partners/ppg_rpygls.svg)](https://ppg.com/)\n\n[![84 Lumber](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/v1693245166/prd/assets/penguins/assets/partners/84_lumber_t6krva.svg)](https://www.84lumber.com/)\n\n[![DICK'S](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/v1721671889/prd/assets/penguins/assets/DSG-2024-logo_e6gf85.png)](https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/)\n\n[![FedEx](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/v1693245170/prd/assets/penguins/assets/partners/fedex_w4e11s.svg)](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html)\n\n[![F.N.B.](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/v1693245172/prd/assets/penguins/assets/partners/fnb_ua1bb7.svg)](https://www.fnb-online.com/)\n\n[![Ford](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/v1693245173/prd/assets/penguins/assets/partners/ford_cc5sr1.svg)](https://www.buyfordnow.com/)\n\n[![Highmark](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/v1693245175/prd/assets/penguins/assets/partners/highmark_ugfolx.svg)](https://highmark.com/)\n\n[![Coca-Cola](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/v1721315685/prd/assets/penguins/assets/partners/coke-script-logo.png)](https://www.nhl.com/penguins/community/hockey-fights-cancer)\n\n[![Rivers Casino](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/v1721316733/prd/assets/penguins/assets/partners/v2Rivers_Casino_Stacked_White.png)](https://www.riverscasino.com/pittsburgh/)\n\n[![UPMC](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_q-best/v1693245180/prd/assets/penguins/assets/partners/upmc_lxzan2.svg)](https://www.upmc.com/)\n\n[![Pittsburgh Penguins logo](https://assets.nhle.com/logos/nhl/svg/PIT_dark.svg)](https://www.nhl.com/penguins \"Go to Pittsburgh Penguins Homepage\")\n\npittsburghpenguins.com is the official website of the Pittsburgh Penguins.
