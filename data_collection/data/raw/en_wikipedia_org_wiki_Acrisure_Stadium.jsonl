It primarily serves as the home of the [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\") of the [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\") (NFL) and the [Pittsburgh Panthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Panthers_football \"Pittsburgh Panthers football\") of the [NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Bowl_Subdivision \"NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision\") in the [Atlantic Coast Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference \"Atlantic Coast Conference\") (ACC). The stadium opened in 2001 as Heinz Field, following the [controlled implosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_implosion \"Building implosion\") of the teams' previous home, [Three Rivers Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\"). In 2021, the owners of the Heinz name, now owned by [Kraft Heinz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Heinz \"Kraft Heinz\") declined to renew the stadium's [naming rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_rights \"Naming rights\"). The City of Pittsburgh green-lit [Acrisure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure \"Acrisure\")'s bid to purchase the rights in 2022.\n\nFunded in conjunction with [PNC Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park \"PNC Park\") and the [David L. Lawrence Convention Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_L._Lawrence_Convention_Center \"David L. Lawrence Convention Center\"), the $281 million (equivalent to $499 million in 2024) stadium stands along the [Ohio River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_River \"Ohio River\"), on the [North Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Side_(Pittsburgh) \"North Side (Pittsburgh)\") of Pittsburgh in the North Shore neighborhood. The stadium was designed with the city's history of steel production in mind, which led to the inclusion of 12,000 tons of steel into construction.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-FactSh-10) Ground for the stadium was broken in June 1999, and the first football game was hosted in September 2001. The stadium's natural-grass surface has been criticized throughout its history, but Steelers owners have kept the grass after lobbying from players and coaches. The 68,400-seat stadium has sold out for most Steelers home games, a streak that dates to 1972. A collection of Steelers and Panthers memorabilia is in the Great Hall.\n\nThe stadium has hosted two [outdoor hockey games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_outdoor_games \"NHL outdoor games\"): the [2011 NHL Winter Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_NHL_Winter_Classic \"2011 NHL Winter Classic\") between the [Pittsburgh Penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins \"Pittsburgh Penguins\") and [Washington Capitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals \"Washington Capitals\"), and the [2017 NHL Stadium Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_NHL_Stadium_Series \"2017 NHL Stadium Series\") game between the Penguins and [Philadelphia Flyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Flyers \"Philadelphia Flyers\"). The venue has also hosted numerous concerts; on June 17, 2023, [Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift \"Taylor Swift\")'s [The Eras Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour \"The Eras Tour\") performance was attended by 73,117 people, the highest-ticketed event in Pittsburgh history.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-PPG61723-5)\n\n## History\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acrisure_Stadium&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")\\]\n\n### Planning and funding\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acrisure_Stadium&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Planning and funding\")\\]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers and [Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates \"Pittsburgh Pirates\") shared [Three Rivers Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\") from 1970 to 2000. After discussions over the Pirates building a full-time [baseball park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park \"PNC Park\"), a proposal was made to renovate Three Rivers Stadium into a full-time football facility.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Bflawed-11) Although the Steelers' owners disliked the idea, the proposal was used as a \"fallback position\" that would be used if discussions for a new stadium failed.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Steelers_Sell_Bonds_to_Help_Raise_Money_for_New_Stadium-12) The Steelers' owners said failing to build a new stadium would hurt the franchise's chances of signing players who might sign with other teams, such as the other three teams in the [AFC North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North \"AFC North\"), who had all recently built new football-only stadiums.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Heinz_Field:_Standing_Up_to_the_Competition-13) In June 2001, the [H. J. Heinz Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._J._Heinz_Company \"H. J. Heinz Company\") purchased the naming rights to the stadium.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-deckard-14) Per the deal, Heinz would pay the Steelers a total of $57 million through 2021, the \"57\" being an intentional reference to [Heinz 57](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_57 \"Heinz 57\").[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Stadium_naming_rights-15) Despite Heinz later announcing its acquisition of [Kraft Foods Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods_Group \"Kraft Foods Group\") to form [Kraft Heinz Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Heinz_Company \"Kraft Heinz Company\") in 2015, the stadium's name was retained.[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-VXu16-16)\n\nOriginally, a [sales tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax \"Sales tax\") increase was proposed to fund three projects: Heinz Field, PNC Park, and an expansion of the [David L. Lawrence Convention Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_L._Lawrence_Convention_Center \"David L. Lawrence Convention Center\"). After the rejection of this proposal in a 1997 referendum known as the \"Regional Renaissance Initiative\", the city developed the alternate funding proposal _Plan B_.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Plan_B-17) Similarly controversial, the proposal was labeled _Scam B_ by opponents.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-TD-18) The Steelers' pledge toward the new stadium was criticized for being too little, even after it was raised from $50 million to $76.5 million.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Bflawed-11)[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Cranmer_Still_Optimistic_on_Plan_B_Deal-19) Other local government members criticized the $281 million of public money allocated for _Plan B_.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Bflawed-11)[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Team_Sale_Would_Trigger_Review_of_Public_Stadium_Funding-20) One member of the [Allegheny Regional Asset District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_Regional_Asset_District \"Allegheny Regional Asset District\") board called the use of tax dollars \" [corporate welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_welfare \"Corporate welfare\")\".[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-barnes-21) The plan, totaling $809 million, was approved by the Allegheny Regional Asset District board on July 9, 1998, with $233 million allotted for Heinz Field.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-barnes-21)[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Arena_Won't_Be_Part_of_Plan_B-22) Shortly after Plan B was approved, the Steelers made a deal with Pittsburgh city officials to stay in the city until at least 2031.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-TD-18) The total cost of Heinz Field was $281 million.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Premium-23)\n\n### Design and construction\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acrisure_Stadium&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Design and construction\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/HZ_FIELD2.svg/250px-HZ_FIELD2.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HZ_FIELD2.svg) Former Heinz Field logo; the stadium changed its name in 2022\n\n[HOK Sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_(company) \"Populous (company)\") designed the stadium.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Football_Stadium_Architect_Selected-24) HOK Sport's project manager for the project, Melinda Lehman, said that the [Rooney family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_family \"Rooney family\") asked for the stadium's design to \"acknowledge the history of Pittsburgh and also bring in an element of looking forward, this is where Pittsburgh is going.\"[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Lehman-25) In order to accomplish this, HOK Sport used steel structurally and externally.[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Lehman-25) The stone used in Acrisure Stadium's design is [artificial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_stone \"Cast stone\"), in order to decrease cost.[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Lehman-25) Of the glass used in the stadium's design, Lehman said, \"The glass is a more modern building element, which ties into a lot of the buildings in \\[Downtown\\] Pittsburgh and gives great views of the surrounding areas.\"[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Lehman-25) The Steelers and Panthers have their own locker rooms, which differ in size based on the number of players each team is permitted to dress for each game.

Either \"Steelers\" or \"Panthers\" was painted in the end zone, depending on the game, during the first three years. For the 2002 Steelers regular season, the area covered by gold paint was reduced to just around the words. The design for the 2002 Wild Card matchup replaced the white letter outlines with athletic gold paint and removed it everywhere else.\n\nIn 2003, the Steelers played the Philadelphia Eagles in a preseason game with plain diagonal white lines in the South end zone, which were common in NFL end zones until the 1960s. Although the Steelers lost the game 21–16, team president [Dan Rooney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Rooney \"Dan Rooney\") liked the look of the South end zone being \"plain\", and decided to bring it back the next year. The 2003 season was the last year to date which contained \"PITTSBURGH\" and \"Steelers\" in black words with athletic gold outlines in both end zones.\n\nBeginning in 2004, the wordmark designs were flipped in paint color, \"PITTSBURGH\" in the North and \"Steelers\" in the South were now athletic gold with the former having either dark blue outlines for Pitt or black for the Steelers. The diagonal white lines in the South end zone during the college portion of the season began in this year too, with \"Steelers\" being added after Pitt has played their final home game of the year. In the aforementioned Dolphins-Steelers Monday Night Football match of 2007, the surface conditions had become so deteriorated from the rain and gameplay itself that the field grid of hash marks, yard lines, mid-field logo, and wordmarks in both end zones were barely visible throughout the game. Sideline hash marks (painted orange) and yard lines were re-painted at halftime.\n\nFrom 2001 through 2010, there was typically no midfield logo when both Pitt and the Steelers were in season; the Steelers had their logo painted on the sidelines when Pitt's football season was ongoing and transferred it to midfield after Pitt's football season ended (except for the first two seasons when it was only added for the postseason). As of the 2011 season, Pitt and the Steelers in cooperation have their respective logos at midfield for their own homes games, being interchanged frequently.\n\nBeing a member of the [American Football Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference \"American Football Conference\") (AFC), the grounds crew of Acrisure Stadium has painted the conference logo in both end zones for every Pittsburgh Steelers postseason home game to date. Recently, after the end of the Pittsburgh Panthers season, fans and players, including [T. J. Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Watt \"T. J. Watt\") and [J. J. Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Watt \"J. J.

These boxes were predicted to increase the Steelers' profits from $10 to $11 million per season over those at Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium also features 6,600 club seats that include a restaurant and an indoor bar, at prices up to $2,000 per person.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Premium-23) For the 2010 season, season ticket prices for Panthers games ranged from a maximum of $295 per club seat with required donations per seat between $250 and $500 depending on location, to as low as $87 per seat with no required donation for upper end zone sections.

The Hall includes a timeline of the Steelers franchise's major events and an oversized Steelers helmet hanging from the ceiling beside a video screen that shows entertainment for fans throughout game days.[\\[102\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-GH-102) The Great Hall also features the actual lockers of several former Steelers, including [Hall of Fame members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame \"Pro Football Hall of Fame\") Franco Harris, [Joe Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Greene \"Joe Greene\"), and [Bill Dudley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Dudley \"Bill Dudley\").[\\[102\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-GH-102)\n\nSix large [Lombardi Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi_Trophy \"Vince Lombardi Trophy\")-shaped display columns were erected and contain artifacts from each championship the Steelers have won including replica trophies.[\\[103\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-SGH-103) Two display columns are dedicated to the University of Pittsburgh and contain memorabilia from the Panthers' teams.

The plan would increase seating up to 69,050 as soon as the 2012 NFL season.[\\[104\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Steelers_Consider_Expanding_Heinz_Field-104) Seating was added in that section for the 2011 NHL Winter Classic, which had an attendance of 68,111. The temporary seating was left in place for the 2010–11 NFL playoffs, with the AFC Championship game on January 23 having a record attendance of 66,662.[\\[105\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Steelers_Climb_Stairway_to_Seventh_Heaven-105)\n\nOn April 12, 2012, the Steelers confirmed they would seek approval from the NFL to expand seating by 3,000.[\\[106\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Steelers_Move_to_Add_3,000_Seats_to_Heinz_Field-106) On May 19, 2014, after more than two years, the Steelers and the SEA came to an agreement to add about 3,000 seats to the venue.[\\[107\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-I4RpQ-107) After contractors surveyed the complex the final number of 2,390 added seats with five additional suites including more parking, restrooms and concessions was determined in December 2014 to increase capacity to a total of 68,400. The seating was put in place by the summer of 2015.[\\[108\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium#cite_note-Qzm3z-108)\n\nOn September 10, 2016, the then-largest crowd of 69,983 to ever see a sporting event in Pittsburgh watched the Pitt Panthers defeat the [Penn State Nittany Lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Nittany_Lions \"Penn State Nittany Lions\"), 42–39 as they renewed their rivalry in football. On September 1, 2022, a crowd of 70,622 fans broke the record attendance for a sporting event in Pittsburgh again, as No. 17 Pitt defeated the West Virginia Mountaineers 38–31 in the first Backyard Brawl since 2011.\n\n## Transportation access\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acrisure_Stadium&action=edit&section=19 \"Edit section: Transportation access\")\\]\n\nAcrisure Stadium is located at Exit 1B of [Interstate 279](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_279 \"Interstate 279\") within a mile of direct access to both [Interstate 376](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_376 \"Interstate 376\") and [Interstate 579](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_579 \"Interstate 579\").
