The French built [Fort Duquesne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Duquesne \"Fort Duquesne\") based on LaSalle's 1669 claims.

On March 8, 1771, [Bedford County, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_County,_Pennsylvania \"Bedford County, Pennsylvania\") was created to govern the frontier.\n\nOn April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as [Pitt Township](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitt_Township,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania \"Pitt Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania\").[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-35)[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-36) William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[\\[37\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-37)\n\nFollowing the [American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution \"American Revolution\"), the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow.

In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785.

Unrest during the [Whiskey Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion \"Whiskey Rebellion\") of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area.

[Fort Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pitt_(Pennsylvania) \"Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)\") (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the [Northwest Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territory \"Northwest Territory\").\n\n### 19th century\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: 19th century\")\\]\n\nFurther information: [Pennsylvania in the American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_in_the_American_Civil_War \"Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\")\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Monongahela_River_Scene_Pittsburgh_PA_1857.jpg/250px-Monongahela_River_Scene_Pittsburgh_PA_1857.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Monongahela_River_Scene_Pittsburgh_PA_1857.jpg)\n\nThe [Monongahela River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monongahela_River \"Monongahela River\") and its surroundings in 1857\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Pittsburgh_1874_Otto_Krebs.jpg/250px-Pittsburgh_1874_Otto_Krebs.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pittsburgh_1874_Otto_Krebs.jpg)\n\n[Lithograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography \"Lithography\") of Pittsburgh by [Otto Krebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Krebs \"Otto Krebs\") (before 1874)\n\nThe federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the [Lewis and Clark Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition \"Lewis and Clark Expedition\").[\\[38\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-38) Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when [Meriwether Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meriwether_Lewis \"Meriwether Lewis\") purchased a [keelboat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keelboat \"Keelboat\") that would later be used to ascend the [Missouri River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River \"Missouri River\").[\\[39\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-39)\n\nThe [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\") cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city.

There were active stations of the [Underground Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad \"Underground Railroad\") in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-freedom-40) The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[\\[41\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-exhibit-41) Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada.

From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-freedom-40)\n\nThe [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\") boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. [Andrew Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie \"Andrew Carnegie\") began steel production in 1875 at the [Edgar Thomson Steel Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Thomson_Steel_Works \"Edgar Thomson Steel Works\") in [North Braddock, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Braddock,_Pennsylvania \"North Braddock, Pennsylvania\"), which evolved into the [Carnegie Steel Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Steel_Company \"Carnegie Steel Company\"). He adopted the [Bessemer process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessemer_process \"Bessemer process\") to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\n\n### 20th century\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: 20th century\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Thaddeus_M._Fowler_-_Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_1902.jpg/250px-Thaddeus_M._Fowler_-_Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_1902.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thaddeus_M._Fowler_-_Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania_1902.jpg)\n\nAn aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902[\\[42\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-42)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Mills_in_Strip_District%2C_Pittsburgh_%2884.41.70%29.jpg/250px-Mills_in_Strip_District%2C_Pittsburgh_%2884.41.70%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mills_in_Strip_District,_Pittsburgh_(84.41.70).jpg)\n\nSteel mills in the [Strip District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_District,_Pittsburgh \"Strip District, Pittsburgh\") in 1906\n\nIn 1901, [J.

By 1910, Pittsburgh was the [nation's eighth-largest city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_cities_in_the_United_States_by_population_by_decade \"Largest cities in the United States by population by decade\"), accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\n\nThe [Pittsburgh Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Agreement \"Pittsburgh Agreement\") was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by [T.

By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[\\[44\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-44) Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American [Great Migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American) \"Great Migration (African American)\") from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[\\[45\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-45) Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-46)\n\nDuring [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-Lorant-29) This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry.

The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-diaspora-12)\n\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n\n### 21st century\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: 21st century\")\\]\n\nDuring the [late 2000s recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_2000s_recession \"Late 2000s recession\"), Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them.
