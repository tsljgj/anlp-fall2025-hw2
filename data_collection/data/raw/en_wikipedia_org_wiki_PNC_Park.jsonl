It is the fifth location to serve as the [ballpark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark \"Ballpark\") of [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball \"Major League Baseball\")'s [Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates \"Pittsburgh Pirates\").[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-official-8)[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-ESPN-9) Opened during the [2001 MLB season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Major_League_Baseball_season \"2001 Major League Baseball season\"), PNC Park sits along the [Allegheny River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_River \"Allegheny River\") with a view of the [Downtown Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Pittsburgh \"Downtown Pittsburgh\") skyline. Constructed of [steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel \"Steel\") and [limestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone \"Limestone\"), it has a [natural grass playing surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae#Sports_turf \"Poaceae\") and can seat 38,747 people for baseball. It was built just to the east of its predecessor, [Three Rivers Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\"), which was demolished in 2001.\n\nPlans to build a new stadium for the Pirates originated in 1991 but did not come to fruition for five years. Funded in conjunction with [Acrisure Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium \"Acrisure Stadium\") and the [David L. Lawrence Convention Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_L._Lawrence_Convention_Center \"David L. Lawrence Convention Center\"), the park was built for $216 million in 24 months, faster than most modern stadiums. Built in the \"retro-classic\" style modeled after past venues such as Pittsburgh's [Forbes Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Field \"Forbes Field\"), PNC Park also introduced unique features, such as the use of [limestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone \"Limestone\") in the building's facade.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-official-8) The park has a riverside concourse, steel truss work, an extensive out-of-town scoreboard, and local eateries. Several tributes to former Pirate [Roberto Clemente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Clemente \"Roberto Clemente\") are incorporated into the ballpark, and the nearby [Sixth Street Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Clemente_Bridge \"Roberto Clemente Bridge\") was renamed in his honor. In addition to the Pirates' regular-season and postseason home games, PNC Park has hosted other events, including the [2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game \"2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game\") and numerous concerts.\n\n[PNC Financial Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Financial_Services \"PNC Financial Services\") originally purchased the [naming rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_rights \"Naming rights\") in 1998 for $30 million over 20 years,[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-PNCfs-10)[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-11) and currently holds the rights through 2031.[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-12)\n\nSeveral writers have called PNC Park one of the best baseball stadiums in America, citing its location, views of the Pittsburgh skyline and Allegheny River, timeless design, and clear angles of the field from every seat.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-kdka15-13)[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-wapo2017-14)[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-15)[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-16)\n\n## History\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PNC_Park&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")\\]\n\n### Planning and funding\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PNC_Park&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Planning and funding\")\\]\n\nOn September 5, 1991, Pittsburgh mayor [Sophie Masloff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Masloff \"Sophie Masloff\") proposed a new 44,000-seat stadium for the [Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates \"Pittsburgh Pirates\") on the city's North Side.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-OnDeck-17) [Three Rivers Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\"), the Pirates' and [Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")' home at the time, had been designed for functionality rather than \"architecture and aesthetics\".[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-OnDeck-17) As well, its location made it hard to reach from much of the city, with traffic congestion before and after games.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-18) Discussions about a new ballpark took place, but were never seriously considered until entrepreneur [Kevin McClatchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McClatchy \"Kevin McClatchy\") purchased the team in February 1996. Until McClatchy's purchase, plans about the team remaining in Pittsburgh were uncertain.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-OnDeck-17) In 1996, Masloff's successor, [Tom Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Murphy_(mayor) \"Tom Murphy (mayor)\"), created the \"Forbes Field II Task Force\". Made up of 29 political and business leaders, the team studied the challenges of constructing a new ballpark. Their final report, published on June 26, 1996, evaluated 13 possible locations. The \"North Side site\" was recommended due to its affordable cost, potential to develop the surrounding area, and opportunity to incorporate the city skyline into the stadium's design.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-OnDeck-17) The site selected for the ballpark is just upriver from the site of early Pirates home field [Exposition Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_Park_(Pittsburgh) \"Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)\").[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-19)[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-20)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/PNC_Park_satellite_view.png/250px-PNC_Park_satellite_view.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PNC_Park_satellite_view.png) An aerial view of the venue\n\nAfter a political debate, public money was used to fund PNC Park. Originally, a [sales tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax \"Sales tax\") increase was proposed to fund three projects: PNC Park, Heinz Field (home of the Steelers, now called [Acrisure Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium \"Acrisure Stadium\")), and an expansion of the [David L. Lawrence Convention Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_L._Lawrence_Convention_Center \"David L. Lawrence Convention Center\"). That proposal was soundly rejected in a 1997 [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum \"Referendum\") known as the Regional Renaissance Initiative.\n\nThe city then developed _Plan B,_[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-21) which proved similarly controversial. It was labeled _Scam B_ by opponents[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-TD-22) who said it would consume too much public money; one member of the [Allegheny Regional Asset District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_Regional_Asset_District \"Allegheny Regional Asset District\") board called the use of tax dollars \" [corporate welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_welfare \"Corporate welfare\")\"[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-barnes-23)[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-24) while others said the Pirates should contribute more than their pledged $40 million. Still, the board approved Plan B on July 9, 1998; it included $228 million for PNC Park in a total package of $809 million.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-barnes-23)[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-25) Shortly thereafter, the Pirates made a deal with Pittsburgh city officials to remain in the city until at least 2031.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-TD-22)\n\nThere was popular sentiment by fans for the Pirates to name the stadium after former outfielder [Roberto Clemente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Clemente \"Roberto Clemente\"). However, locally based [PNC Financial Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Financial_Services \"PNC Financial Services\") purchased the stadium's naming rights in August 1998.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-PNCfs-10)[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-26) Under the agreement, [PNC Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Financial_Services#PNC_Bank \"PNC Financial Services\") paid the Pirates about $2 million each year through 2020; it also maintains a full-service PNC branch at the stadium.[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-27)[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-28) The total cost of PNC Park was $216 million.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-official-8)[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-ESPN-9) Shortly after the naming rights deal was announced, the city of Pittsburgh renamed the 6th Street Bridge near the southeast corner of the site of the park the [Roberto Clemente Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Clemente_Bridge \"Roberto Clemente Bridge\") as a compromise to fans who had wanted the park named after Clemente.[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-29)\n\n### Design and construction\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PNC_Park&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Design and construction\")\\]\n\nKansas City-based [Populous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_(company) \"Populous (company)\") (then HOK Sport), which designed many other major league ballparks of the late 20th and early 21st century, designed the ballpark.[\\[30\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-30)[\\[31\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-31) The design and construction management team consisted of the Dick Corporation and Barton Malow.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-official-8) An effort was made in the design of PNC Park to salute other \"classic style\" ballparks, such as [Fenway Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park \"Fenway Park\"), [Wrigley Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field \"Wrigley Field\"), and Pittsburgh's [Forbes Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Field \"Forbes Field\"); the design of the ballpark's archways, steel truss work, and light standards are results of this goal.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-official-8)[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-Plunkett-32) PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since [Milwaukee County Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_County_Stadium \"Milwaukee County Stadium\") opened in [1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Major_League_Baseball_season \"1953 Major League Baseball season\").[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-ESPN-9)[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-Plunkett-32) The park features a 24 by 42 foot (7.3 by 12.8 m) [Sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony \"Sony\") [JumboTron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JumboTron \"JumboTron\"), which is accompanied by the first-ever LED video boards in an outdoor MLB stadium.[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-technology-33) PNC Park is the first stadium to feature an out-of-town scoreboard with the score, [inning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning \"Inning\"), number of [outs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball) \"Out (baseball)\"), and [base runners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baserunning \"Baserunning\") for every other game being played around the league.[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-technology-33) The out-of-town scoreboard was disabled for the 2022 season and replaced with advertising. After significant fan outcry, the decision was reversed, and the out-of-town scoreboard was returned in 2023.\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/PNC_Park_with_Roberto_Clemente_Bridge_May_2018.jpg/250px-PNC_Park_with_Roberto_Clemente_Bridge_May_2018.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PNC_Park_with_Roberto_Clemente_Bridge_May_2018.jpg) The 6th Street Bridge was renamed the [Roberto Clemente Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Clemente_Bridge \"Roberto Clemente Bridge\") in honor of the former Pirate.\n\nGround was broken for PNC Park on April 7, 1999,[\\[34\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-34) after a ceremony to christen the newly renamed Roberto Clemente Bridge.[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-35) As part of original plans to create an enjoyable experience for fans, the bridge is closed to vehicular traffic on game days to allow spectators to park in [Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Pittsburgh \"Downtown Pittsburgh\") and walk across the bridge to the stadium.[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-36)[\\[37\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-37) PNC Park was built with [Kasota limestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasota_limestone \"Kasota limestone\") shipped from a [Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota \"Minnesota\") river valley, to contrast the brick bases of other modern stadiums.[\\[38\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-Newjewel-38) The American-made raw steel for the ballpark was fabricated in [Brownsville, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownsville,_Pennsylvania \"Brownsville, Pennsylvania\"), by Wilhelm and Krus.[\\[39\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-39) The stadium was constructed over a 24-month span—at the time of construction, three months faster than any other modern major league ballpark—and the Pirates played their first game less than two years after groundbreaking.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-Extrainn-40) The quick construction was accomplished with the use of special computers, which relayed building plans to builders 24 hours per day.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-Extrainn-40) In addition, all 23 labor unions involved in the construction signed a pact that they would not [strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action \"Strike action\") during the building process.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-Extrainn-40) As a result of union involvement and attention to safety regulations, the construction manager, the Dick Corporation, received a merit award for its safety practices from the [Occupational Safety and Health Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration \"Occupational Safety and Health Administration\").[\\[41\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-workers-41)\n\n### Statues\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=PNC_Park&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Statues\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Honus_Wagner_and_PNC_Park_%283894720800%29.jpg/250px-Honus_Wagner_and_PNC_Park_%283894720800%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Honus_Wagner_and_PNC_Park_(3894720800).jpg) The limestone exterior of the park at the home plate entrance, with a statue of [Honus Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honus_Wagner \"Honus Wagner\")\n\nStatues of Pirates [Hall of Famers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum \"National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\") [Honus Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honus_Wagner \"Honus Wagner\"), Roberto Clemente, [Willie Stargell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Stargell \"Willie Stargell\"), and [Bill Mazeroski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mazeroski \"Bill Mazeroski\") sit outside of PNC Park.\n\n[Wagner's statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Honus_Wagner \"Statue of Honus Wagner\"), unveiled at Forbes Field in 1955,[\\[42\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-42)[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park#cite_note-HonHit-43) was later moved to a location outside Three Rivers Stadium.
