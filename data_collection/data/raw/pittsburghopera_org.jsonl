Our Mission\n\nPittsburgh Opera enriches Pittsburgh and the tri-state area and draws national and international attention to the region by:\n\n- Creating live opera at the highest standards of artistic excellence\n- Making opera accessible to a diverse audience\n- Developing young singers into tomorrow’s artists\n- Ensuring the future through responsible fiscal management\n\nThe current leader of Pittsburgh Opera is [Christopher Hahn](https://pittsburghopera.org/our-team/staff/christopher-hahn-general-director?hsLang=en), who became Artistic Director in 2000 and General Director in 2008. During his tenure he has considerably expanded the company’s repertoire to include Baroque and many contemporary works, and he has vigorously upheld Pittsburgh Opera’s high standards of management and artistic excellence. He has expanded the [Resident Artist Program](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists?hsLang=en) to include two annual productions, both of which are offered as part of the full subscription series. He led the move to [Bitz Opera Factory](https://pittsburghopera.org/facilities/pittsburgh-opera-headquarters/?hsLang=en) in the historic George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory at 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, and developed a range of audience and community programs that take place there.\n\nPittsburgh Opera's current Music Director, [Antony Walker](https://pittsburghopera.org/our-team/staff/antony-walker-music-director?hsLang=en), was appointed in 2005 and has brought an engaged and highly informed leadership to the company’s musical forces as well as developing a music staff of note.\n\n**[Download the Pittsburgh Opera Fact Sheet here.](https://pittsburghopera.org/hubfs/Pittsburgh%20Opera%20Facts%20Sheet%2c%20v5%2c%205.4.25.pdf?hsLang=en)**\n\n### Our Beginnings\n\nFounded in 1939 by five intrepid women who belonged to Pittsburgh’s Tuesday Musical Club (pianist **Virginia C. Byerly**; contralto **Carolyn Hunt Mahaffey**; **Priscilla W. Collins**; **Ruby N. Wickersham**; and **Marie M. Pease**), these Founding Five established The Pittsburgh Opera Society, which would become the seventh-oldest opera company in the United States.\n\nThe first production, in March 1940 at Carnegie Music Hall, was **The Tales of Hoffmann**, with Mahaffey as Nicklausse. The company’s first conductor, [Richard Karp](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19770203&id=0XIqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IFcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6801,497204&hl=en) of Vienna, led Pittsburgh Opera for nearly 40 years and oversaw the company’s move to Heinz Hall in 1971.\n\nIn 1983, [Tito Capobianco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Capobianco), a stage director and prominent figure at New York City Opera, became Pittsburgh Opera’s General Director. Capobianco molded the Opera into an influential national company and a steward of cultural life in Pittsburgh. Under his direction, the Opera established its own orchestra, pioneered the use of supertitles, formed the Resident Artists Program and dramatically increased the region's audience for opera.\n\nMark Weinstein’s appointment as General Director in 1997 marked another milestone in the company’s growth. Weinstein, pursued rigorous financial management and long-range strategic planning.

opera journey begins today!\n\nIntimidated by opera? Don't be! Let's debunk some common opera myths together!\n\nIf you’ve never been to the opera before, you may have some misconceptions. Don't worry, you're not alone! So let's shake off your preconceptions and learn what going to the opera is really like...\n\nCome as you are or glam it up!\n\nOn weeknights people often show up in what they wore to the office that day, and on Fridays and Sundays, we see everything from dressy to jeans. On Saturdays – opening nights – some like to wear a suit or step out in a special dress. But just wear whatever makes you feel comfortable!\n\n_Everyone in this photo is dressed perfectly for the opera! (Photo credit: David Bachman)_\n\nTickets to Pittsburgh Opera's mainstage shows at the Benedum and Byham start at only $15... children and teens can even get in at half that price. That's less than a movie ticket and some popcorn!\n\nThere are even discounts for [groups of 6+](https://pittsburghopera.org/tickets/groups-tickets?hsLang=en), [students](https://www.pittsburghopera.org/tickets/student-tickets/cheapseats/?hsLang=en), [20-Something Tuesdays](https://pittsburghopera.org/tickets/promotions-and-discounts/?hsLang=en) and more.\n\nEnglish texts are always projected above the stage, just like subtitles at the movies. While many operas are in Italian, German, or French, there are many in English too. You'll understand every word!\n\nDo you think sword fights are boring? What about dancing, poisonings, secret plots, epic romances, or twist endings?\n\nOperas have these in spades! That's why the term \"operatic\" has come to mean \"dramatic to the nth degree.\"\n\n_These two will slice your notions of \"boring\" to threads! (Photo credit: David Bachman)_\n\nOperas come in all shapes and sizes!\n\nThe shortest opera we know of is 13 minutes long, and the longest one takes 7 days! You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under \"Details and Resources.\" Many operas are the same length as any musical or play, with an intermission or two along the way.\n\nJust like music has changed a lot in the last 400 years, opera has too!\n\nWhile almost all operas make use of \"classical voice technique,\" which give operas their signature vocal style, the musical style can vary from Baroque to even Hip Hop!\n\nPittsburgh Opera: We Shall Not Be Moved - \"This is My Body\" - YouTube\n\n[Photo image of Pittsburgh Opera](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBHJTnYxZ04DnAA8GUP0wqg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fpittsburghopera.org%2Fabout%2Foperamyths%2F)\n\nPittsburgh Opera\n\n1.45K subscribers\n\n[Pittsburgh Opera: We Shall Not Be Moved - \"This is My Body\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiCbjIMiKfU)\n\nPittsburgh Opera\n\nWatch later\n\nShare\n\nCopy link\n\nInfo\n\nShopping\n\nTap to unmute\n\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\n\nMore videos\n\n## More videos\n\nYou're signed out\n\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

And if you want to nerd out you can go to the [Pre Opera Talk](https://pittsburghopera.org/season/free-low-cost-events/pre-opera-talks?hsLang=en), [Meet The Artists](https://pittsburghopera.org/season/free-low-cost-events/meet-the-artists?hsLang=en), or pick up a [Study Guide](https://pittsburghopera.org/education/resources/study-guides?hsLang=en) at our education table. But you don’t need to do any of those to enjoy the show and understand what’s happening!\n\nNot so! There are many comic operas, operas for children, and heartwarming love stories too.\n\nWhile there are operas that will truly break your heart or scare you to your core, opera plays with every human emotion, especially the good ones!\n\n_Who doesn't love a happy ending?

PDF](https://pittsburghopera.org/hubfs/Pittsburgh_Opera_NEA_Grant_2018.pdf?hsLang=en)\n\n### Pittsburgh Opera to Receive $25,000 NEA Grant\n\nPittsburgh Opera will receive a $25,000 Art Works grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to help support the new production of [**Moby-Dick**](https://pittsburghopera.org/season/past-seasons/moby-dick?hsLang=en) by composer [Jake Heggie](http://jakeheggie.com/) and librettist [Gene Scheer](http://genescheer.com/) which will make its Pittsburgh debut March 17th.\n\nThe grant is part of the more than $25 million in grants which NEA Chairman Jane Chu has approved as part of the NEA’s first major funding announcement for fiscal year 2018.  The Art Works category is the NEA’s largest funding category and supports projects that focus on the creation of art that meets the highest standards of excellence, public engagement with diverse and excellent art, lifelong learning in the arts, and/or the strengthening of communities through the arts.\n\n“It is energizing to see the impact that the arts are making throughout the United States. These NEA-supported projects, such as this one to Pittsburgh Opera, are good examples of how the arts build stronger and more vibrant communities, improve well-being, prepare our children to succeed, and increase the quality of our lives,” said Chu. “At the National Endowment for the Arts, we believe that all people should have access to the joy, opportunities and connections the arts bring.”\n\n“We appreciate this strong endorsement from the NEA” said Pittsburgh Opera General Director Christopher Hahn. “This new production of **Moby-Dick** will help introduce thousands of people to opera.”\n\nPittsburgh Opera is a co-producer of the new production of Moby-Dick, which was built by [Utah Opera](http://www.utahopera.org/) and debuted in Salt Lake City this January to great acclaim.  The [_Salt Lake Tribune_](https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/arts/2018/01/21/moby-dick-opera-transforms-a-massive-novel-into-a-human-scaled-epic/#gallery-carousel-8605074) said “Erhard Rom’s abstract set design, Jessica Jahn’s exhaustively researched costumes and Kristine McIntyre’s authoritative stage direction pull the audience into the action.”\n\n**Moby-Dick**, which is sung in English, will be performed at the Benedum Center March 17, 20, 23 and 25. Tickets start at just $12, with Children’s Tickets starting at only $6. Tickets are [available online](https://opera.culturaldistrict.org/production/51760/list_performances), by phone at 412-456-6666, or in person at the Theater Square Box Office, 665 Penn Avenue, downtown.\n\nFor more information on projects included in the NEA grant announcement, visit [arts.gov/news](http://www.arts.gov/news).", "source_category": "music_culture", "source_root_url": "https://pittsburghopera.org/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:22:24.293275", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 15855, "cleaned_content_length": 15223, "word_count": 936, "char_count": 15223, "description": ""}}

against the backdrop of bohemian Paris, La Bohème follows four impoverished artists surviving with little more than friendship, passion, and their love for art.\n\nWhen Rodolfo, a poet, and Mimì, a young seamstress, meet, the two are drawn into a tumultuous and passionate affair with a love that can only be broken by death.\n\nLa Bohème will make you laugh, and bring you to tears, with its timeless story and captivating music.\n\nEmotional and dramatic, it’s no wonder Puccini’s most celebrated opera has transcended the genre, inspiring both a ballet and the Broadway hit musical RENT.\n\nAntony Walker conducts; Kristine McIntyre directs.\n\n_These performances are sponsored in part by generous gifts from The Gailliot Fund and Drs.

They are joined by their comrades—Colline, a young philosopher, and Schaunard, a musician who has landed a job and brings food, fuel, and funds (Legna! . . . Sigari!). While they celebrate their unexpected fortune, the landlord, Benoit, arrives to collect the rent. Plying the older man with wine, they urge him to tell of his flirtations, then throw him out in mock indignation. As the friends depart for a celebration at the nearby Café Momus, Rodolfo promises to join them soon, staying behind to finish writing an article. There’s another knock; a neighbor, Mimì, says her candle has gone out on the drafty stairs. Offering her wine when she feels faint, Rodolfo relights her candle and helps her to the door. Mimì realizes she has dropped her key, and as the two search for it, both candles are blown out. In the moonlight the poet takes the girl's shivering hand (Che gelida manina \"What a cold little hand\") telling her his dreams. She then recounts her solitary life (Sì, mi chiamano Mimì \"Yes, they call me Mimì\"), embroidering flowers and dreaming of spring. Drawn to each other, Mimì and Rodolfo leave for the café (O soave fanciulla \"Oh lovely girl\").\n\n**ACT II.** Amid shouts of street hawkers, Rodolfo buys Mimì a bonnet near the Café Momus and introduces her to his friends. They all sit and order supper. A toy vendor, Parpignol, passes by, besieged by children. Marcello's former lover, Musetta, enters on the arm of the older wealthy Alcindoro. Determined to make Marcello jealous and test his attraction to her, Musetta flirtatiously sings a waltz. (Quando me’n vo “When I walk out”). Complaining that her shoe pinches, Musetta sends Alcindoro to fetch a new pair, then falls into Marcello's arms. The Bohemians leave Alcindoro to face the bill when he returns.\n\n**ACT III.** At dawn on the snowy outskirts of Paris, a Customs Officer admits street sweepers and farm women to the city. Musetta and revelers are heard inside a tavern. Soon Mimì arrives searching for Marcello. When the painter emerges, she pours out her distress over Rodolfo's incessant jealousy (Mimì! . . . Speravo di trovarvi qui). It is best they part, he says. Mimì hides as Rodolfo emerges from the tavern. He tells Marcello he wants to separate from his fickle sweetheart. Pressed further, he breaks down, saying Mimì is dying; her ill health can only worsen in the poverty they share. Overcome, Mimì stumbles forward from her hiding place to bid her lover farewell (Addio . . . D'onde lieta uscì al tuo grido) as Marcello runs back into the tavern to investigate Musetta's raucous laughter. While Mimì and Rodolfo recall their happiness, Musetta quarrels with Marcello (Dunque è proprio finite). Mimì and Rodolfo decide to stay together until spring.\n\n**ACT IV.** Some months later, Rodolfo and Marcello lament their loneliness in the garret (O Mimì, tu più non torni). Colline and Schaunard bring a meager meal. The four stage a dance, which turns into a mock fight. The merrymaking is ended when Musetta bursts in, saying Mimì is downstairs, too weak to climb up. As Rodolfo runs to her, Musetta tells how Mimì has begged to be taken to her lover to die. While Mimì is made comfortable, Marcello goes with Musetta to sell her earrings for medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his cherished overcoat (Vecchia zimarra \"Old coat\"). Alone, Mimì and Rodolfo recall their first days together (Sono andati? \"Have they gone?\"), but she is seized with coughing. When the others return, Musetta gives Mimì a muff to warm her hands and prays for her life. Mimì dies quietly (Dorme? . . . Riposa), and when Schaunard discovers she is dead, Rodolfo runs to her side, calling her name.\n\n-Courtesy of Opera News\n\nWant to know what **La Bohème** sounds like?

with fate.**\n\nA woman driven mad by the mystery of her lost son learns of her boy’s unfortunate fate from a chance encounter with a Ferryman while crossing a river.\n\nBased on the Japanese Noh play _Sumidigawa River_, Curlew River retells this story as a Christian parable. Written in the style of monastic plain song and laden with musical symbolism, this piece artfully melds theatrical simplicity with ecumenical grandeur.\n\nIn keeping with these themes and this opera’s history, Curlew River will be staged at Calvary Episcopal Church in Shadyside.\n\nAntony Walker conducts; Dana Kinney directs.\n\nWhere: Calvary Episcopal Church, Shadyside\n\nWhen:\n\n- Saturday, January 24, 2026 \\* 7:00 PM\n- Tuesday, January 27, 2026 \\* 7:00 PM\n- Friday, January 30, 2026 \\* 7:00 PM\n- Sunday, February 1, 2026 \\* 4:00 PM\n\nThe Ferryman: [Erik Nordstrom](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/erik-nordstrom?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nThe Madwoman: [Logan Wagner](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/logan-wagner?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nThe Abbot: [Matthew Soibelman](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/matthew-soibelman?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nThe Traveler: [Yazid Gray](https://www.yazidgray.com/)\\*\\*\n\nConductor:  [Antony Walker](https://www.pittsburghopera.org/our-team/staff/antony-walker-music-director/?hsLang=en)\n\nStage Director: [Dana Kinney](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/dana-kinney?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nStage Manager: Tess Naval\n\nAssistant Stage Manager: Bee Anderson\n\n+   Pittsburgh Opera debut\n\n\\*     Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist\n\n\\*\\*   Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist Alumnus\n\nThe scene is set in a church by a Fenland river in early medieval times. A group of monks, acolytes, and lay brethren process in with their Abbot, intoning the plain-chant “Te lucis ante terminum.” The lay brothers go to their instruments and the Abbot announces the performance of a mystery showing how a sign of God’s grace was given.\n\nThe monks who are to play the Madwoman, the Traveller, and the Ferryman are ceremonially costumed. The Madwoman and the Traveller leave the acting area. The Ferryman, whose duty it is to ferry pilgrims across the Curlew River, steps forward. Today is the day when they come to visit a grave on the other bank which is revered as a shrine. There was a burial there a year ago, and the folk believe it can heal the sick.\n\nThe Traveller approaches. He has been long on the road and he begs for a place on the ferry, which the Ferryman grants. The Madwoman’s cries are heard in the distance as she sings about curlews, lambs, and crows. When she appears, her confused singing includes the mention of her child, and the pilgrims listen to her in amazement. She tells how her son was seized by a stranger, and how she has lost her mind in despair. She begs to get into the boat, but the Ferryman refuses, alarmed by her strange story. Eventually the Traveller, the Abbot, and the pilgrims persuade the Ferryman to allow her on board, and a sail is hoisted.\n\nAs the ferry crosses to the other bank, the Ferryman tells how a year before a Heathen man came and left behind a boy who had been ill-treated and was very weak. The boy was able to say he head been stolen from his mother before dying with a prayer on his lips. He was buried nearby.\n\nThe ferry has reached the bank and the sail is lowered. All go ashore to visit the boy’s tomb except the Madwoman. The Ferryman impatiently tels the Madwoman to be on her way, until her questions reveal that she is his mother and this was the boy she lost. She leads the lamentation, in which all join, her prayers mingling with images of birds and flight. A child’s voice is heard and the Spirit of the Child appears above the tomb. He blesses his mother with the promise that they will meet in Heaven.\n\nThe Madwoman, the Ferryman, and the Traveller resume their monks’ habits and all recss chanting the “Te lucis.”\n\n_– Hugh Macdonald, Mark Morris Dance Group_\n\nWant to know what **Curlew River** sounds like?

fALsTAFF\n\nMusic by Giuseppe Verdi\n\nLibretto adapted by Arrigo Boito from the play _The Merry Wives of Windsor_ and scenes\n\nfrom _Henry IV_, Part 1 and Part 2, by William Shakespeare • APRIL 28, MAY 1, 3, 2026\n\n[BUY TICKETS](https://opera.culturaldistrict.org/production/99223/falstaff)\n\nLaugh last, laugh best.\n\nBeloved buffoon Sir John Falstaff has fallen on hard times. But being a ladies’ man (or so he’d like to think), he drunkenly schemes to cash in on his wit and charm by wooing the wealthy wives of Windsor, Alice Ford and Meg Page. However, when these women uncover that he has sent them both identical love letters, they hatch a plan of their own to teach Falstaff a lesson he won’t soon forget!\n\nThe music matches the merriment and mischief of this madcap romp. See why Verdi’s buoyant comedy, based on Shakespeare’s _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, is considered one of the best comedic operas of all time!\n\nAntony Walker conducts; Crystal Manich directs.\n\n_These performances are sponsored in part by The Gailliot Fund._\n\n(photo credit: David Allen for Opera San Jose)\n\n(photo credit: David Allen for Opera San Jose)\n\n(photo credit: David Allen for Opera San Jose)\n\n(photo credit: David Allen for Opera San Jose)\n\n(photo credit: David Allen for Opera San Jose)\n\n(photo credit: David Allen for Opera San Jose)\n\n(photo credit: David Allen for Opera San Jose)\n\nWhere: Benedum Center, at the corner of 7th Street and Penn Ave, downtown Pittsburgh\n\nWhen:\n\n- Tuesday, April 28, 2026 \\* 7:00 PM\n- Thursday, April 30, 2026 \\* 10:30 AM [Student Matinee](https://pittsburghopera.org/education/students?hsLang=en)\n- Friday, May 1, 2026 \\* 7:00 PM\n- Sunday, May 3, 2026 \\* 3:00 PM\n\nSir John Falstaff, a knight: [Michael Chioldi](https://www.michaelchioldi.com/)\n\nFord, a wealthy man: [Blake Denson](https://www.blakeadenson.com/) +\n\nAlice Ford, his wife:  [Danielle Pastin](https://www.daniellepastin.com/)\\*\\*\n\nNannetta, their daughter:  [Shannon Crowley](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/shannon-crowley?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nMeg Page: [Audrey Welsh](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/audrey-welsh?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nMistress Quickly: [Marianne Cornetti](http://www.mariannecornetti.com/)\\*\\*\n\nFenton, one of Nannetta's suitors: [Logan Wagner](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/logan-wagner?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nPistola, a follower of Falstaff: [Matthew Soibelman](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/matthew-soibelman?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nDr. Caius: [Joseph Frank](http://www.josephfranktenor.com/)\n\nBardolfo: [Michael Pegher](http://www.michaelpegher.com/index.html) +\n\nConductor:  [Antony Walker](https://www.pittsburghopera.org/our-team/staff/antony-walker-music-director/?hsLang=en)\n\nStage Director :  [Crystal Manich](https://www.crystalmanich.com/)\n\nSet Designer: Steven C.

Dr. Caius bursts into Sir John Falstaff’s room in the Garter Inn, accusing him of unseemly behavior the previous night. He further accuses Falstaff’s two henchmen, Bardolph and Pistol, of having robbed him while he was drunk. Unable to obtain reparations, Dr. Caius leaves in a fury. Falstaff contemplates the large bill he has run up at the inn. He informs Bardolph and Pistol that in order to repair his finances he plans to seduce Alice Ford and Meg Page, both wives of prosperous Windsor citizens. When Bardolph and Pistol refuse to deliver the letters Falstaff has written to the two ladies, Falstaff instructs a page to do so instead. He then ridicules Bardolph and Pistol’s newly discovered sense of honor, before throwing them out of his room.\n\nThe Garter Inn. Alice Ford and Meg Page laugh over the identical love letters they have received from Sir John Falstaff. They share their amusement with Alice’s daughter Nannetta, and with their friend Mistress Quickly. Ford arrives, followed by four men all proffering advice: Dr. Caius, whom Ford favors as Nannetta’s future husband; Bardolph and Pistol, who are now seeking advantageous employment from Ford; and Fenton, who is in love with Ford’s daughter Nannetta. When Ford learns of Falstaff’s plan to seduce his wife, he immediately becomes jealous. While Alice and Meg plan how to take revenge on their importunate suitor, Ford decides to disguise himself in order to pay a visit to Falstaff. Unnoticed in the midst of all the commotion, Nannetta and Fenton manage to steal a few precious moments together.\n\nACT II\n\nThe Garter Inn. Feigning penitence, Bardolph and Pistol rejoin Falstaff’s service. They show in Mistress Quickly, who informs Falstaff that both Alice and Meg are madly in love with him. She explains that it will be easier to seduce Alice, since her husband is out of the house every afternoon, between two and three. Falstaff joyously anticipates his seduction of Alice. Bardolph now announces that a “Mister Brook” (Ford in disguise) wishes to speak to Falstaff. To Falstaff’s surprise, “Brook” offers him wine and money if he will seduce Alice Ford, explaining that he has long been in love with the lady, but to no avail. If she were to be seduced by the more experienced Falstaff, she might then be more likely to fall a second time and accept “Brook.” Falstaff agrees to the plan, telling his surprised new friend that he already has a rendezvous with Alice that very afternoon. As Falstaff leaves to prepare himself, Ford gives way to jealous rage. When Falstaff returns, dressed in his best clothes, the two men exchange compliments before leaving together.\n\nFord’s house. Mistress Quickly, Alice and Meg are preparing for Falstaff’s visit. Nannetta tearfully tells her mother that her father insists on her marrying Dr. Caius, but Alice tells her daughter not to worry. Falstaff arrives and begins his seduction of Alice, nostalgically boasting of his aristocratic youth as page to the Duke of Norfolk. As Falstaff becomes more amorous, Meg Page interrupts the tête-à-tête, as planned, to announce (in jest) that Ford is approaching. But just at that point Mistress Quickly suddenly returns in a panic to inform Alice that Ford really is on his way, and in a jealous temper. As Ford rushes in with a group of townsfolk, the terrified Falstaff seeks a hiding place, eventually ending up in a large laundry basket. Fenton and Nannetta also hide. Ford and the other men ransack the house. Hearing the sound of kissing, Ford is convinced that he has found his wife and her lover Falstaff together, but is furious to discover Nannetta and Fenton instead. While Ford argues with Fenton, Alice instructs her servants to empty the laundry basket out of the window. To general hilarity, Falstaff is thrown into the River Thames.\n\nACT III\n\nOutside the Garter Inn. A wet and bruised Falstaff laments the wickedness of the world, but soon cheers up with a glass of mulled wine. Mistress Quickly persuades him that Alice was innocent of the unfortunate incident at Ford’s house. To prove that Alice still loves him, she proposes a new rendezvous that night in Windsor Great Park. In a letter that Quickly gives to Falstaff, Alice asks the knight to appear at midnight, disguised as the Black Huntsman. Ford, Nannetta, Meg, and Alice prepare the second part of their plot: Nannetta will be Queen of the Fairies and the others, also in disguise, will help to continue Falstaff’s punishment. Ford secretly promises Caius that he will marry Nannetta that evening. Mistress Quickly overhears them.\n\nWindsor Great Park. As Fenton and Nannetta are reunited, Alice explains her plan to trick Ford into marrying them. They all hide as Falstaff approaches. On the stroke of midnight, Alice appears. She declares her love for Falstaff, but suddenly runs away, saying that she hears spirits approaching. Nannetta, disguised as the Queen of the Fairies, summons her followers who attack the terrified Falstaff, pinching and poking him until he promises to give up his dissolute ways. In the midst of the assault Falstaff suddenly recognizes Bardolph, and realizes that he has been tricked. While Ford explains that he was “Brook,” Quickly scolds Falstaff for his attempts at seducing two younger, virtuous women. Falstaff accepts that he has been made a figure of fun, but points out that he remains the real source of wit in others. Dr. Caius now comes forward with a figure in white. They are to be married by Ford. Alice brings forward another couple, who also receive Ford’s blessing. When the brides remove their veils it is revealed that Ford has just married Fenton to Nannetta, and Dr. Caius to Bardolph. With everyone now laughing at his expense, Ford has no choice but to forgive the lovers and bless their marriage. Before sitting down to a wedding supper with Sir John Falstaff, the entire company agrees that the whole world may be nothing but a jest filled with jesters, but he who laughs last, laughs best.\n\n— Metropolitan Opera\n\nWant to know what **Falstaff** sounds like?

stylish film noir look\n\n_Photo by Cory Weaver for Lyric Opera of Kansas City_\n\nCharming nobleman. Serial womanizer. Sexual predator. Don Giovanni is all these and more. As the list of people out to get him grows longer, eventually his misdeeds are bound to catch up with him.\n\nPittsburgh Opera starts its 81st season with a Mozart masterpiece. Don Giovanni leaves a trail of broken hearts, and worse, wherever he goes. He has his servant, the reluctant doormat Leporello, keep a journal of Don Giovanni’s many romantic conquests. Completely without morals or a conscience, Don Giovanni sexually assaults Donna Anna, then kills her father the Commendatore, who had tried to come to her defense. He seduces young Zerlina on her wedding day. But all actions have consequences, as Don Giovanni is soon to learn.\n\nAn irresistible classic, Mozart’s [**Don Giovanni**](https://pittsburghopera.org/season/past-seasons/don-giovanni?hsLang=en) seamlessly combines comedy and tragedy with one of the great musical scores of all time to create one of the world’s favorite operas.\n\nAs always, English supertitles will be projected above the stage.\n\nWhere: Benedum Center for the Performing Arts, downtown Pittsburgh\n\nWhen:\n\n- Sat., Oct. 12, 2019 \\* 8:00 PM\n- Tues., Oct. 15, 2019 \\* 7:00 PM\n- Fri., Oct. 18, 2019 \\* 7:30 PM\n- Sun., Oct. 20, 2019 \\* 2:00 PM\n\nRun Time: 3 hours, 10 minutes, with one intermission\n\nLanguage: Sung in Italian with English texts projected above the stage\n\n1. The original/full title of the opera is “ **Don Giovanni, or The Libertine Punished**.” As a morality tale, Don Giovanni ultimately pays for his evil actions with his life.\n2. Movie buffs will love the opera’s stylish film noir look, with Easter Eggs paying homage to classic noir movies such as **Double Indemnity**, **The Third Man**, **Out of the Past**, **Kiss Me Deadly**, and **The Big Sleep**, among others. Director Kristine McIntyre explains the noir treatment in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YUERnyJOfM).\n3. As part of the film noir look, the entire opera - costumes and set - is black and white, with some very intentional exceptions, adding to the eery, dark feeling of the show.\n4. **Don Giovanni** was the first opera to use a trombone.\n\nSingle tickets for adults start at $14; tickets for kids and teens ages 6-18 are half-price.

CARMEN\n\n_By Georges Bizet, with a libretto by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy_• Mar. 26, 29 & Apr. 1, 3, 2022\n\nSet in 1830 Seville, Spain, _**Carmen**_ is a roller-coaster of lust, deception, and murder. Fiery free-spirit Carmen, who lives her life to the fullest, can have any man she wants. But when she seduces naïve Corporal Don José, she gets more than she bargains for.\n\nCarmen works in a cigarette factory. When a knife fight with another employee leads to her arrest, she charms Corporal Don José into letting her escape. Like a moth drawn to a flame, Don José forsakes his military career and the innocent peasant girl Micaëla for a life on the lam with Carmen and a band of smugglers. Never one to settle down, the passionate Carmen gets bored with Don José and becomes involved with the glamourous, testosterone-filled bullfighter Escamillo. Left with nothing, Don José decides that if he can’t have Carmen, no one can.\n\nFull of magnetic melodies, colorful costumes, and tragic twists, you’ll fall in love with George Bizet’s one-and-only Carmen.\n\n[Antony Walker](https://pittsburghopera.org/our-team/staff/antony-walker-music-director?hsLang=en) conducts; [Garnett Bruce](http://www.garnettbruce.com/) directs.\n\nFrasquita (Véronique Filloux) and Dancäire (Yazid Gray) - (photo credit: David Bachman)\n\nCarmen (Zanda Švēde) is always the center of attention (photo credit: David Bachman)\n\nMicaëla (Danielle Pastin) and Don José (Scott Quinn) - (photo credit: David Bachman)\n\nEscamillo (Michael Todd Simpson) sings of the glories of being a toreador (photo credit: David Bachman)\n\nCarmen (Zanda Švēde) uses her charms to convince Don José (Scott Quinn) to let her escape (photo credit: David Bachman)\n\nFrasquita (Véronique Filloux) and Dancäire (Yazid Gray) - (photo credit: David Bachman)\n\nCarmen (Zanda Švēde) is always the center of attention (photo credit: David Bachman)\n\n[Zanda Švēde](https://www.zandasvede.com/) +: Carmen\n\n[Scott Quinn](https://www.guybarzilayartists.com/Scott-Quinn) +: Don José\n\n[Michael Todd Simpson](http://michaeltoddsimpson.com/): Escamillo\n\n[Danielle Pastin](https://www.daniellepastin.com/)\\*\\*: Micaëla\n\nBob Rak: Lillas Pastia+\n\n[Leah Heater](https://www.leahdegruyl.com/)\\*\\*: Mercédès\n\nJeremy Harr\\*: Zuniga\n\nYazid Gray\\*: Dancäire\n\nAndrew Turner [\\*](https://www.pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2021-22-resident-artists/andrew-turner/?hsLang=en): Remendado\n\nVéronique Filloux\\*: Frasquita\n\n[Daniel Teadt](http://danielteadt.com/): Moralès\n\n**The Artistic Team**\n\nConductor - [Antony Walker](https://pittsburghopera.org/our-team/staff/antony-walker-music-director?hsLang=en)\n\nStage Director - [Garnett Bruce](http://www.garnettbruce.com/)\n\nSet Designer - R.

Among them is Micaëla, a peasant girl, who asks for a corporal named Don José. Moralès, another corporal, tells her he will return with the changing of the guard. The relief guard, headed by Lieutenant Zuniga, soon arrives, and José learns from Moralès that Micaëla has been looking for him.\n\nWhen the factory bell rings, the men of Seville gather to watch the female workers— especially their favorite, Carmen. She tells her admirers that love is free and obeys no rules (\"L’amour est un oiseau rebelle\"). Only one man pays no attention to her: Don José. Carmen throws a flower at him, and the girls go back to work. José picks up the flower and hides it when Micaëla returns. She brings a letter from José’s mother, who lives in a village in the countryside (\"Ma mere, je la vois\"). As he begins to read the letter, Micaëla leaves.\n\nJosé is about to throw away the flower when a fight erupts inside the factory between Carmen and another girl. Zuniga sends José to retrieve Carmen. She refuses to answer Zuniga’s questions, and José is ordered to take her to prison. Left alone with him, she entices Jose with suggestions of a rendezvous at Lillas Pastia’s tavern (\"Près des remparts de Séville\"). Mesmerized, he agrees to let her get away. As they leave for prison, Carmen escapes. Don José is arrested.\n\n**ACT II.** Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Mercédès entertain the guests at the tavern (\"Les tringles des sistres tintaient\"). Zuniga tells Carmen that José has just been released. The bullfighter Escamillo enters, boasting about the pleasures of his profession (\"Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre\"), and flirts with Carmen, who tells him that she is involved with someone else.\n\nAfter the tavern guests have left with Escamillo, the smugglers Dancaïre and Remendado explain their latest scheme to the women (\"Nous avons en tête une affaire\"). Frasquita and Mercédès are willing to help, but Carmen refuses because she is in love. The smugglers withdraw as José approaches.\n\nCarmen arouses José's jealousy by telling him how she danced for Zuniga. She dances for him now, but when a bugle call is heard he says he must return to the barracks (\"Je vais danser en votre honneur\"). Carmen mocks him. To prove his love, José shows her the flower she threw at him and confesses how its scent made him not lose hope during the weeks in prison (\"La fleur que tu m’avais jetée\"). She is unimpressed: if he really loved her, he would desert the army and join her in a life of freedom in the mountains. José refuses, and Carmen tells him to leave. Zuniga bursts in, and in a jealous rage José fights him. The smugglers return and disarm Zuniga. José now has no choice but to join them.\n\n**ACT III.** Carmen and José quarrel in the smugglers’ mountain hideaway. She admits that her love is fading and advises him to return to live with his mother. When Frasquita and Mercédès turn the cards to tell their fortunes, they foresee love and riches for themselves, but Carmen’s cards spell death—for her and for José (\"Melons! Coupons!\").\n\nMicaëla appears, frightened by the mountains and afraid to meet the woman who has turned José into a criminal (\"Je dis que rien ne m’épouvante\"). She hides when a shot rings out. José has fired at an intruder, who turns out to be Escamillo. He tells José that he has come to find Carmen, and the two men fight (\"Je suis Escamillo\"). The smugglers separate them, and Escamillo invites everyone, Carmen in particular, to his next bullfight.\n\nWhen he has left, Micaëla emerges and begs José to return home. He agrees when he learns that his mother is dying, but before he leaves he warns Carmen that they will meet again.\n\n**ACT IV.** Back in Seville, the crowd cheers the bullfighters on their way to the arena (\"A deux cuartos\"). Carmen arrives on Escamillo’s arm, and Frasquita and Mercédès warn her that Jose is nearby. Unafraid, she waits outside the entrance as the crowds enter the arena. Jose appears and begs Carmen to forget the past and start a new life with him (\"C’est toi! C’est moi!\"). She calmly tells him that their affair is over: she was born free and free she will die. The crowd is heard cheering Escamillo. José keeps trying to win Carmen back. She takes off his ring and throws it at his feet before heading for the arena. José stabs her to death.\n\n\\- Adapated from _Opera News_\n\nWe want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!\n\nHere are some details and resources to help. Also visit our [Opera FAQs](https://pittsburghopera.org/tickets/opera-faqs/?hsLang=en) or our [Accessibility page](https://pittsburghopera.org/tickets/accessibility/?hsLang=en).\n\n- Run time: 2 hours and 50 minutes including two intermissions\n\n- Understand Every Word: **Carmen** is sung in French, but has English supertitles projected above the stage at all performances\n\n- Download the [**Carmen** study guide](https://pittsburghopera.org/hubfs/PDFs/Education%20PDFs/Resources%20PDFs/Study%20Guides%20PDFs/2021-22%20Season/Study_Guide_for_Carmen_2019.pdf?hsLang=en)\n\n- Parking Downtown: [get real-time parking availability](http://parkpgh.org/)\n\n- [Pre-Opera Talks](https://pittsburghopera.org/season/free-low-cost-events/pre-opera-talks?hsLang=en) before each performance\n\n- [Braille Programs](https://pittsburghopera.org/tickets/accessibility/?hsLang=en) available at The Benedum Center\n\n- [Large-Print Programs](https://pittsburghopera.org/tickets/accessibility/?hsLang=en) available at The Benedum Center\n\n**CHILD POLICY:**\n\n- Children must be ages 6 and up.

We train teachers of all grade levels to integrate arts so thousands of students can enjoy opera.\n\n### Workshops for Educators\n\nOur signature program is a unique, fun, and stimulating professional learning opportunity for teachers of all grade levels in all content areas.\n\nWorkshop topics include the five 2025–2026 season operas plus additional arts integration materials so that teachers have additional resources to use in their classes. Each workshop is recorded so that participants can attend live or at a later time. We include live presentations and/or performances by guest artists. And, we provide some of the workshop materials in advance for participants to explore at their convenience, so the actual “live” workshop time is short and engaging. We offer a total of six 1.5 hour workshops on Saturday mornings from 10:30 am–12:00 pm via Zoom, with a one hour networking time afterwards, plus one in-person set tour at the Bitz Opera Factory.\n\nThere is no cost to attend the workshop.

FELLOW TRAVELERS\n\nMusic by Gregory Spears\n\nLibretto by Greg Pierce\n\nBased on the novel by Thomas Mallon • NOVEMBER 14, 15, 16, 2025\n\n[BUY TICKETS](https://opera.culturaldistrict.org/production/99219/fellow-travelers)\n\nThe Red Scare, tinted lavender.\n\nAt the height of the McCarthy era, naive college graduate Timothy Laughlin comes to Washington eager to join the crusade against communism. But a chance encounter with a handsome State Department official, Hawkins Fuller, leads to Tim’s first job—and his first relationship with a man.\n\nUnder the threat of increased government scrutiny, this complicated and clandestine affair will put both men’s loyalties and convictions to the ultimate test. As the poisonous political climate pollutes their relationship, love becomes a casualty of what it takes to “play the game” in Washington.\n\nBased on Thomas Mallon’s 2007 gut-wrenching novel, _Fellow Travelers_ was praised as “a near-perfect example of fast-flowing musical drama” by _The New York Times_ and is already widely considered a contemporary classic.\n\nAntony Walker conducts; Brian Staufenbiel directs.\n\n(photo credit: Dave Pearson, Virginia Opera)\n\n(photo credit: Dave Pearson, Virginia Opera)\n\n(photo credit: Dave Pearson, Virginia Opera)\n\n(photo credit: Dave Pearson, Virginia Opera)\n\n(photo credit: Dave Pearson, Virginia Opera)\n\n(photo credit: Dave Pearson, Virginia Opera)\n\n(photo credit: Dave Pearson, Virginia Opera)\n\nWhere: Byham Theater, downtown Pittsburgh\n\nWhen:\n\n- Friday, November 14, 2025 \\* 7:00 PM\n- Saturday, November 15, 2025 \\* 7:00 PM\n- Sunday, November 16, 2025 \\* 2:00 PM\n\nHawkins Fuller: [Erik Nordstrom](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/erik-nordstrom?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nTimothy Laughlin: [Logan Wagner](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/logan-wagner?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nMary Johnson: [Shannon Crowley](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/shannon-crowley?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nMiss Lightfoot: [Lauryn Davis](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/lauryn-davis?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nTommy McIntyre: [Yazid Gray](https://www.yazidgray.com/)\\*\\*\n\nLucy: [Audrey Welsh](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/audrey-welsh?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nPotter's Assistant/Bookseller/Party Guest/Technician/French Priest:  [Matthew Soibelman](https://pittsburghopera.org/resident-artists/2024-25resident-artists/matthew-soibelman?hsLang=en)\\*\n\nSenator Joseph McCarthy/Estonian Frank/Interrogator: [Daniel Teadt](http://danielteadt.com/about/)\\\\*\\\\*\n\nSenator Charles Potter/General Arlie/Bartender: [Joel Balzun](https://www.joelbalzun.com/) +\n\nConductor:  [Antony Walker](https://www.pittsburghopera.org/our-team/staff/antony-walker-music-director/?hsLang=en)\n\nStage Director and Concept Designer:  [Brian Staufenbiel](https://brianstaufenbiel.sites.ucsc.edu/) +\n\nScene & Props Designer: Jacquelyn Scott\n\nOriginal Costume, Wig & Make-Up Designer: Y.

Eisenhower is president. Senator Joseph McCarthy is stoking fears that the U.S. federal government is full of Communists, Soviet spies, and homosexuals.\n\nScene 1\n\nPark in Dupont Circle. A fledgling reporter, Timothy Laughlin, sits on a bench reviewing his notes from McCarthy’s wedding when he is approached by State Department employee Hawkins Fuller.\n\nScene 2\n\nSenator Charles Potter’s Office. Timothy is hired as a speechwriter for Senator Charles Potter. Timothy meets Tommy McIntyre, who gives him unsolicited advice about Washington politics.\n\nScene 3\n\nHawkins’s Office. Timothy stops by Hawkins’s office to drop off a thank-you gift. He meets Hawkins’s assistant and best friend Mary, and his secretary Miss Lightfoot, who mocks Timothy after he leaves.\n\nScene 4\n\nTimothy’s Apartment. Timothy is at home cooking soup and writing his sister a letter when Hawkins unexpectedly stops by to tell him about the delights of Bermuda, among other things.\n\nScene 5\n\nSt. Peter’s Church. In the afterglow of last night’s encounter with Hawkins, Timothy is torn between his deep Catholicism and his blossoming passion.\n\nScene 6\n\nThe Hotel Washington. At a Christmas party, Timothy is approached by an Army general about enlisting; Mary warns Hawkins about his reckless behavior with Timothy; McIntyre tells Potter about McCarthy’s latest political troubles; Miss Lightfoot overhears an intimate exchange between Hawkins and Timothy.\n\nScene 7\n\nInterrogation Room M304. An interrogator puts Hawkins through a series of humiliating tests in an attempt to determine whether or not he is a homosexual.\n\nScene 8\n\nTimothy’s Apartment. Timothy and Hawkins discuss the interrogation, McCarthy, and Hawkins’s illicit amusements in New York City.\n\nScene 9\n\nMcCarthy’s Office. Senator Potter warns McCarthy that the “Adams Chronology,” which details how Roy Cohn and McCarthy pressured the Army to give Cohn’s friend David Schine special treatment, will be McCarthy’s downfall unless he gives up Cohn.\n\nScene 10\n\nMary’s Kitchen/Timothy’s Apartment. Mary invites Timothy over to warn him of Hawkins’s fickle nature. She tells Timothy she is pregnant from a one-night stand. In Timothy’s apartment, Hawkins rejoices that he’s been cleared of allegations of homosexuality. Timothy is shocked by how Hawkins wants to celebrate.\n\nScene 11\n\nRoof of the Old Post Office. Timothy, in agony over his fraught relationship, tells Hawkins he’s decided to enlist in the Army.\n\nScene 12\n\nHawkins’s Office. Mary tells Hawkins she is quitting, as she can no longer work in an atmosphere of panic and persecution.\n\nScene 13\n\nTimothy in France/Hawkins in Chevy Chase. Three years pass. Timothy writes letters to Hawkins and Mary from France, where he is stationed. Hawkins is now married to a woman named Lucy, with a house in the suburbs, but would clearly like to rekindle his relationship with Timothy upon his return.\n\nScene 14\n\nBrick House. In a house in D.C. that Hawkins has rented for his afternoon flings with Timothy, Hawkins expresses that he cannot be everything Timothy wants. Hawkins resolves to end the affair himself.\n\nScene 15\n\nMary’s Kitchen/Brick House/Room M304. Mary is packing when Hawkins stops by, distraught. Hawkins confesses that in order to push Timothy away, he has given Timothy’s name to those investigating alleged homosexuals. He asks Mary to tell Timothy about this betrayal in hopes it will make Timothy hate him.\n\nScene 16\n\nPark in Dupont Circle. His dreams dashed, Timothy decides to leave Washington, D.C., and Hawkins Fuller for good. Both heartbroken, they say goodbye.\n\n_–Courtesy of Greg Pierce, Cincinnati Opera_\n\nWant to know what **Fellow Travelers** sounds like?

a Legacy of Inclusion with a Future-Focused Vision**_\n\nPittsburgh Opera has long been committed to enriching our region through live, world-class opera that is accessible, engaging, and reflective of our community. In keeping with this legacy—and with an eye toward the future—we are proud to continue and elevate this important, holistic work.\n\n‘Strategic Impact and Engagement’ supports our values by linking them directly to strategic initiatives throughout Pittsburgh Opera and is an evolution in how we express and integrate them through all we do. It also underscores our commitment to embedding people-centered values—such as diverse perspectives and community collaboration—into every facet of our organization, from our programming, to those people and organizations whom we work with, to the audience experience at our events and performances.\n\nThis work is deeply active and ongoing:\n\n- We use robust community and strategic partnerships to stay honest and responsive to what our community most needs.\n- We offer a wide range of programs and events that are educational, thought-provoking, experiential, and fun.\n- We invest in long-term collaborations that enrich our work and deepen our relationships.\n- We foster an inclusive internal environment that supports our staff, board, and artists—centering belonging, transparency, and collaborative thinking.\n\nBy aligning this work closely with our organizational strategy, we ensure that these values are not siloed or separate, but integral to Pittsburgh Opera’s artistic and administrative excellence. Strategic Impact and Engagement reinforces our belief that the full richness of opera can only be realized when all voices are welcomed, respected, and represented.\n\nWe are rooted in our commitment to reflect these principles in our programming, leadership, teams, and access efforts. We aim to reflect resilience, long-term integration, and a bold reaffirmation of our mission to bring opera to all—now and into the future.\n\nThe Long Walk. 2018.

first class of Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artists, with then-director Tito Capobianco_\n\nSept. 10, 2018\n\nIt is with great sadness that we have learned of the passing of Tito Capobianco.\n\nA truly legendary figure, he helped build Pittsburgh Opera into what it is today. We would not be celebrating our 80th anniversary season this year if it were not for his visionary leadership spanning over 17 years.\n\nTito piloted many programs and features that you see at Pittsburgh Opera today. These range from the English supertitles above all of our productions to the Resident Artist program that helps mold young opera artists in two-years of intensive professional development.\n\nThe fine reputation that Pittsburgh Opera enjoys today is part of Tito's lasting legacy, and  Pittsburgh will never forget his extraordinary contribution to our vibrant cultural life. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends, and mourn the passing of a true titan of the industry.\n\nObituaries:\n\n- [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2018/09/08/Tito-Capobianco-longtime-Pittsburgh-Opera-director-dies-at-87/stories/202001010050)\n- [The San Diego Union Tribune](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/classical-music/sd-me-obit-capobianco-20180909-story.html)\n- [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/obituaries/tito-capobianco-dead.html)\n- [OperaWire](http://operawire.com/obituary-famed-director-tito-capobianco-passes-away/)\n- [Playbill](http://www.playbill.com/article/tito-capobianco-who-brought-ambitious-stagings-to-new-york-city-opera-and-led-pittsburgh-opera-dies-at-87)\n\n_Tito and Gigi Capobianco in front of their portrait at Pittsburgh Opera Headquarters, 2009_", "source_category": "music_culture", "source_root_url": "https://pittsburghopera.org/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:22:24.437233", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 14958, "cleaned_content_length": 13953, "word_count": 745, "char_count": 13953, "description": ""}}

GLORY DENIED\n\nTom Cipullo • February 23, 26, March 1, 3, 2019\n\nBased on a book by Tom Philpott, **Glory Denied** tells the true story of Colonel Jim Thompson, America’s longest-held prisoner of war. The opera deals not only with Thompson’s suffering in the jungle of southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, but also the tragic aftermath that followed his liberation.\n\nColonel Thompson endured his brutal captivity by doggedly clinging to memories of his loving wife Alyce and their children. Alyce, however, believed Jim was dead. She and her children moved to Massachusetts with another man, leading to a painful reunion after Jim’s release.\n\n**Glory Denied** is, above all, the story of an American family during one our nation’s most turbulent eras.  In its review of Mr. Philpott’s book, The New York Times stated:\n\n_Indeed it is not too much to say that **Glory Denied** and Colonel Thompson’s mixed feelings about it encapsulate something of the moral essence of the Vietnam War and the imperishable bitterness of its legacy._\n\n**Glory Denied** will star Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artists, and be performed in the intimate environs of Pittsburgh Opera Headquarters. Limited capacity - order now!\n\n\" _Glory Denied as a whole is in keeping with Pittsburgh Opera’s past record of presenting contemporary works by gifted and impressive Resident Artists. The company deserves praise for consistently offering opportunities to hear rarities delivered by strong, young talent, and patronage is the only reward commensurate with its efforts...the work deserves full houses for all._\" - [Pittsburgh in the Round](https://www.pghintheround.com/pittsburgh-operas-premiere-of-glory-denied/)\n\nOlder Thompson (Benjamin Taylor), Older Alyce (Caitlin Gotimer), Younger Alyce (Ashley Fabian) and Younger Thompson (Terrence Chin-Loy).

He finds the strength to survive in memories of his family, letters from his wife Alyce about their home and children, and thoughts of his elaborate plans to build his dream house.\n\nPregnant with their fourth child and only son, Alyce receives the news that Jim’s plane has been shot down. Denied any reliable information about his status or whereabouts, she soon begins a relationship with another man (Harold), eventually moving with him to Massachusetts and telling her children that their father is dead. Alyce refuses to have Jim’s name released to the public as Missing in Action, or inscribed on a P.O.W. bracelet, a popular solidarity symbol at the time, and consults a lawyer in an effort to have her husband legally declared dead. Thompson, in captivity, finds comfort in the 23rd Psalm.\n\n**Act II.** A number of American P.O.W.s are released and Jim returns home, but the Pentagon honors another man, Everett Alvarez, as the longest-held prisoner. With the signing of the Paris Peace Accords, Jim receives a letter welcoming him back from President Richard Nixon, and suggesting that “some things about America may appear to have changed” since his departure. Alyce greets Jim’s homecoming and confesses her new relationship. She offers to go away if that is what he prefers, but Jim wants to reconcile. He notes how life has changed during his nine year captivity and soon the couple begins to fight with Jim complaining that Alyce is not the wife he left behind. Alyce asserts her independence and describes what her life has been like during his absence. Jim, considered a local hero, is asked to give a sermon at the church where he and Alyce were married, and recalls his idealized family life. But Alyce has moved on.\n\nThe years pass and Jim, having suffered a stroke, lives alone, estranged from his family, struggling with all that has occurred.\n\n-From [Anchorage Opera](https://anchorageopera.org/)\n\n- OperaWire: [Pittsburgh Opera To Premiere ‘Glory Denied’](http://operawire.com/pittsburgh-opera-to-premiere-glory-denied/)\n- Entertainment Central Pittsburgh: [February Theater Guide](https://entertainmentcentralpittsburgh.com/center-stage/feb-2019-theater-guide/)\n- Hoodline: [Best Music Events in Pittsburgh This Week](https://hoodline.com/2019/01/the-best-music-events-in-pittsburgh-this-week)\n- The Almanac: [What's Happening: Week of February 17](https://thealmanac.net/life-culture/whats_happening/what-s-happening-week-of-feb/article_86ee3096-2b03-11e9-96b2-0fbce6be413a.html)\n- Pittsburgh Current: [The Chill Issue: 100 Suggestions To Keep You Busy In Pittsburgh This Winter](https://www.pittsburghcurrent.com/the-chill-issue-100-suggestions-to-keep-you-busy-in-pittsburgh-this-winter/)\n- The Urban Twist: [Q&A: Watch, Listen, and Empathize with Ben Taylor’s Performance in ‘Glory Denied’](https://theurbantwist.com/2019/02/18/qa-watch-listen-and-empathize-with-ben-taylors-performance-in-glory-denied/)\n- Pittsburgh In The Round: [Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Caitlin Gotimer on Upcoming Production of “Glory Denied”](https://www.pghintheround.com/pittsburgh-operas-resident-artist-caitlin-gotimer-on-upcoming-production-of-glory-denied/)\n- NEXTpittsburgh: [Top events in Pittsburgh this weekend](https://www.nextpittsburgh.com/events/top-events-in-pittsburgh-this-weekend-3/)\n- Trib Live: Preview - [Pittsburgh Opera’s ‘Glory Denied’ tells POW’s story](https://triblive.com/aande/theater-arts/pittsburgh-operas-glory-denied-tells-pows-story/)\n- Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: [Behind the Curtain, Feb. 19, 2019 -
