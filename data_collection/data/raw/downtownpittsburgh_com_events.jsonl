Behind the scenes of a disastrous play-within-a-play, a troupe of hapless thespians struggle to bring their production to life. As their rehearsals descend into comedic catastrophe, the actors, director, and stage manager learn the hilarious and hard way what happens when everything that can go wrong does. This uproarious journey will leave you laughing until the final curtain.
