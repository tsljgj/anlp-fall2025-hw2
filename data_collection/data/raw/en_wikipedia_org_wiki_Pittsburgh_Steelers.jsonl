The Steelers compete in the [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\") (NFL) as a member of the [American Football Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference \"American Football Conference\") (AFC) [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North \"AFC North\") division. Founded in [1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1933_Pittsburgh_Pirates_(NFL)_season \"1933 Pittsburgh Pirates (NFL) season\"), the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-History-7)\n\nIn contrast with their status as a perennial losing franchise in the pre- [merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93NFL_merger \"AFL–NFL merger\") NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post- [merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93NFL_merger \"AFL–NFL merger\") (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-i929-8)[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-u452-9)[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-f575-10) The team is tied with the [New England Patriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\") for the most [Super Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\") titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight [AFC championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game \"AFC Championship Game\"), tied with the [Denver Broncos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos \"Denver Broncos\"), but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos, [Dallas Cowboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\"), and [San Francisco 49ers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers \"San Francisco 49ers\") for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight.\n\nThe Steelers, whose history may be traced to a [regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.P._Rooneys \"J.P. Rooneys\"), joined the NFL as the **Pittsburgh Pirates** on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by [Art Rooney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Rooney \"Art Rooney\") and took its original name from the [baseball team of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates \"Pittsburgh Pirates\"), as was common practice for NFL teams at the time.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-History-7) To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the **Rooneymen**, an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-11) Art Rooney's son, [Dan Rooney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Rooney \"Dan Rooney\"), owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, [Art Rooney II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Rooney_II \"Art Rooney II\").\n\nThe Steelers enjoy a large, widespread [fanbase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#Fanbase) nicknamed [Steeler Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeler_Nation \"Steeler Nation\").[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-Mosley-12) They currently play their home games at [Acrisure Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium \"Acrisure Stadium\") on Pittsburgh's [North Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Side_(Pittsburgh) \"North Side (Pittsburgh)\") in the [North Shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore_(Pittsburgh) \"North Shore (Pittsburgh)\") neighborhood, which also hosts the [University of Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh \"University of Pittsburgh\") [Panthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Panthers_football \"Pittsburgh Panthers football\"). Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced [Three Rivers Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\"), which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in [Pitt Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitt_Stadium \"Pitt Stadium\") and at [Forbes Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Field \"Forbes Field\").\n\n## History\n\nFurther information: [History of the Pittsburgh Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Pittsburgh_Steelers \"History of the Pittsburgh Steelers\")\n\nSee also: [American football in Western Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_in_Western_Pennsylvania \"American football in Western Pennsylvania\")\n\n### Rooney family era (1933–present)\n\nThe Steelers first took to the field as the [Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1933_Pittsburgh_Pirates_(NFL)_season \"1933 Pittsburgh Pirates (NFL) season\") on September 20, 1933, losing 23–2 to the [New York Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1933_New_York_Giants_season \"1933 New York Giants season\").[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-History-7) Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 ( [1936](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Pittsburgh_Pirates_(NFL)_season \"1936 Pittsburgh Pirates (NFL) season\")).[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-13) Pittsburgh did make history in [1938](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_Pittsburgh_Pirates_(NFL)_season \"1938 Pittsburgh Pirates (NFL) season\") by signing [Byron White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_White \"Byron White\"), a future [Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States\") of the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court \"U.S. Supreme Court\"), to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the [Detroit Lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions \"Detroit Lions\").[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-History-7)[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-14) Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-g876-15)\n\nDuring World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the [1943 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943_NFL_season \"1943 NFL season\"), they merged with the [Philadelphia Eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles \"Philadelphia Eagles\") forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \" [Steagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steagles \"Steagles\")\". This team went 5–4–1.[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-16) In [1944](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1944_NFL_season \"1944 NFL season\"), they merged with the [Chicago Cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cardinals_(NFL,_1920%E2%80%9359) \"Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920–59)\") and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\").[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-History-7) This team finished 0–10, marking the only winless team in franchise history.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-17)\n\nThe [Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1947 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") made the playoffs for the first time in [1947](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_NFL_season \"1947 NFL season\"), tying for first place in the division at 8–4 with the [Philadelphia Eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_Philadelphia_Eagles_season \"1947 Philadelphia Eagles season\"). This forced a [tie-breaking playoff game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_NFL_playoffs \"1947 NFL playoffs\") at [Forbes Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Field \"Forbes Field\"), which the Steelers lost 21–0.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-18) That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \" [Playoff Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_Bowl \"Playoff Bowl\")\" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-19)\n\nIn [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1970 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"), the year they moved into [Three Rivers Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\") and the year of the [AFL–NFL merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93NFL_merger \"AFL–NFL merger\"), the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed [American Football Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference \"American Football Conference\") (the others being the [Cleveland Browns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns \"Cleveland Browns\") and the [Baltimore Colts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Colts \"Baltimore Colts\")), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-o274-20) The Steelers also received a $3 million ($24.3 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-21)\n\n#### Chuck Noll years (1969–1991)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/1983_Steelers_Police_-_04_Terry_Bradshaw_%28crop%29.jpg/175px-1983_Steelers_Police_-_04_Terry_Bradshaw_%28crop%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1983_Steelers_Police_-_04_Terry_Bradshaw_(crop).jpg) [Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame \"Pro Football Hall of Fame\") quarterback [Terry Bradshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Bradshaw \"Terry Bradshaw\") led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s.\n\nThe Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach [Chuck Noll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Noll \"Chuck Noll\") from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the [1969 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_NFL_season \"1969 NFL season\").[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-22) Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers [\"Mean\" Joe Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Greene \"Joe Greene\") in [1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_NFL_draft \"1969 NFL draft\"), [Terry Bradshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Bradshaw \"Terry Bradshaw\") and [Mel Blount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Blount \"Mel Blount\") in [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_NFL_draft \"1970 NFL draft\"), [Jack Ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ham \"Jack Ham\") in [1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_NFL_draft \"1971 NFL draft\"), [Franco Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Harris \"Franco Harris\") in [1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_NFL_draft \"1972 NFL draft\"),[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-23) and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting four Hall of Famers in one draft year, [Lynn Swann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Swann \"Lynn Swann\"), [Jack Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lambert_(American_football) \"Jack Lambert (American football)\"), [John Stallworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stallworth \"John Stallworth\"), and [Mike Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Webster \"Mike Webster\").[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-n514-24) The Pittsburgh Steelers' [1974 draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_NFL_draft \"1974 NFL draft\") was their best ever; no other team has ever drafted four future Hall of Famers in one year, and only very few (including the 1970 Steelers) have drafted two or more in one year.[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-r189-25)\n\nThe players drafted in the early 1970s formed the base of an NFL dynasty, making the playoffs in eight seasons and becoming the only team in NFL history to win four [Super Bowls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\") in six years, as well as the first to win more than two.[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-26) They also enjoyed a regular-season streak of 49 consecutive wins ( [1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1971 Pittsburgh Steelers season\")– [1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1979 Pittsburgh Steelers season\")) against teams that would finish with a losing record that year.\n\nThe [Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1980 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") suffered a rash of injuries in the [1980 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_NFL_season \"1980 NFL season\") and missed the playoffs with a 9–7 record.[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-27) The [1981 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_NFL_season \"1981 NFL season\") was no better, with an 8–8 showing.[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-28) The team was then hit with the retirements of all their key players from the Super Bowl years. \"Mean\" Joe Greene retired after the [1981 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_NFL_season \"1981 NFL season\"), Lynn Swann and Jack Ham after [1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_NFL_season \"1982 NFL season\")'s playoff berth, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount after [1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_NFL_season \"1983 NFL season\")'s divisional championship, and Jack Lambert after [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_NFL_season \"1984 NFL season\")'s AFC Championship Game appearance.[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-29)\n\nAfter those retirements, the franchise skidded to its first losing seasons since 1971. Though still competitive, the Steelers would not finish above .500 in [1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_NFL_season \"1985 NFL season\"), [1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_NFL_season \"1986 NFL season\"), and [1988](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_NFL_season \"1988 NFL season\"). In [1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_NFL_season \"1987 NFL season\"), the year of the [players' strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_NFL_strike \"1987 NFL strike\"), the [Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1987 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") finished with a record of 8–7, but missed the playoffs.[\\[30\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-30) In [1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_NFL_season \"1989 NFL season\"), they would reach the second round of the playoffs on the strength of [Merrill Hoge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Hoge \"Merrill Hoge\") and [Rod Woodson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Woodson \"Rod Woodson\") before narrowly missing the playoffs in each of the next two seasons, Noll's last seasons.[\\[31\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-v031-31)\n\nNoll's career record with Pittsburgh was 209–156–1.[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-32)\n\n#### Bill Cowher years (1992–2006)\n\nIn 1992, [Chuck Noll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Noll \"Chuck Noll\") retired and was succeeded by [Kansas City Chiefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs \"Kansas City Chiefs\") defensive coordinator [Bill Cowher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cowher \"Bill Cowher\"), a native of the Pittsburgh suburb of [Crafton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crafton,_Pennsylvania \"Crafton, Pennsylvania\").[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-33)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Pittsburgh_Steelers_five_rings.jpg/250px-Pittsburgh_Steelers_five_rings.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pittsburgh_Steelers_five_rings.jpg) Steelers' five Super Bowl rings before 2009\n\nCowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach [Paul Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Brown \"Paul Brown\") of the [Cleveland Browns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns \"Cleveland Browns\"). In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the [AFC Championship Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game \"AFC Championship Game\") three times and following the [1995 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_NFL_season \"1995 NFL season\") an appearance in [Super Bowl XXX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXX \"Super Bowl XXX\") on the strength of the \"Blitzburgh\" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the [Dallas Cowboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Dallas_Cowboys_season \"1995 Dallas Cowboys season\") in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling [AFC Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_AFC_Championship_game \"1995 AFC Championship game\") victory over the [Indianapolis Colts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Indianapolis_Colts_season \"1995 Indianapolis Colts season\").[\\[34\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-34)[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-35) Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in [Super Bowl XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XL \"Super Bowl XL\") over the [NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference \"National Football Conference\") champion [Seattle Seahawks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Seattle_Seahawks_season \"2005 Seattle Seahawks season\") ten years later.[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-j391-36) With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990. He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8–8 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship.\n\nCowher's career record with Pittsburgh was 149–90–1 in the regular season and 161–99–1 overall, including playoff games.[\\[37\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-37)\n\n#### Mike Tomlin years (2007–present)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Ben_Roethlisberger_throwback.jpg/250px-Ben_Roethlisberger_throwback.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ben_Roethlisberger_throwback.jpg) Roethlisberger in a Steelers' throwback jersey during the team's 500th win in franchise history\n\nOn January 7, 2007, Cowher resigned from coaching the Steelers, citing a need to spend more time with his family. He did not use the term \"retire\", leaving open a possible return to the NFL as coach of another team.[\\[38\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-g896-38) A three-man committee consisting of Art Rooney II, Dan Rooney, and Kevin Colbert was set up to conduct interviews for the head coaching vacancy.[\\[39\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-39) On January 22, 2007, [Minnesota Vikings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings \"Minnesota Vikings\") defensive coordinator [Mike Tomlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin \"Mike Tomlin\") was announced as Cowher's successor as head coach.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-40) Tomlin is the first African-American to be named head coach of the team in its 75-year history.[\\[41\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-i182-41) In his first season, he led the Steelers to a 10–6 record and AFC North title.[\\[42\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-l037-42) The team fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars 31–29 in the Wild Card Round to end the season.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-n527-43) The following year, he led the Steelers to a 12–4 mark and a division title.[\\[44\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-z592-44) With wins over the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship,[\\[45\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-45)[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-46) Tomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement.

Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957, with [Lowell Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Perry \"Lowell Perry\")), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973, with [Joe Gilliam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gilliam \"Joe Gilliam\")),[\\[a\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-100) the first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975, with [Franco Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Harris \"Franco Harris\")), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984, with [Tony Dungy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Dungy \"Tony Dungy\")), the first owner to push for passage of an \"equal opportunity\" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer ( [Ariko Iso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariko_Iso \"Ariko Iso\") on July 24, 2002).[\\[100\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-d636-101)\n\n## Championships\n\n### Super Bowl championships\n\n### AFC championships\n\n### Division championships\n\nThe Steelers were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1943 and were briefly in the Western Division in 1944, before returning to the Eastern Division until 1949. The team was then in the American Conference from 1950 to 1952, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Century Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Steelers were placed in the AFC Central until 2001 when they were realigned into the AFC North Division.\n\n## Logo and uniforms\n\nFurther information: [Logos and uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_and_uniforms_of_the_Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Logos and uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers\")\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/US_Airways_Steelers.jpg/250px-US_Airways_Steelers.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Airways_Steelers.jpg) A US Airways A319 featuring the colors and logo of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after [the merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways-American_Airlines_merger \"US Airways-American Airlines merger\").\n\nThe Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the [Philadelphia Eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles \"Philadelphia Eagles\") and formed the \" [Steagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steagles \"Steagles\")\"; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the [Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates \"Pittsburgh Pirates\") in baseball and the [Pittsburgh Penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins \"Pittsburgh Penguins\") in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used \"Vegas Gold\", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers \"gold\" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the [city's official flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania \"Flag of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\").\n\nThe Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the \" [Steelmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmark \"Steelmark\")\", originally designed by Pittsburgh's [U.S. Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Steel \"U.S. Steel\") and now owned by the [American Iron and Steel Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Iron_and_Steel_Institute \"American Iron and Steel Institute\") (AISI). In fact, it was [Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland \"Cleveland\")-based [Republic Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Steel \"Republic Steel\") that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word \"Steelers\" surrounded by three [astroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroid \"Astroid\") ( [hypocycloids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocycloid \"Hypocycloid\") of four [cusps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_(singularity) \"Cusp (singularity)\")). The original meanings behind the astroids were, \"Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world.\" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.[\\[101\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-102) While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word \"Steel\", the team was given permission to add \"ers\" in 1963 after a petition to AISI.\n\nThe Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.[\\[102\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-103) A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more.\n\nThe Steelers, along with the [New York Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants \"New York Giants\"), are one of only two teams in the [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\") to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets.\n\nThe current uniform designs were introduced in [1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1968 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"). The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1970 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") and [1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1971 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In [1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1997 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"), the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font ( [Futura Condensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_Condensed \"Futura Condensed\")) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey.\n\nThe 2007–2011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2007 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"). They were meant to evoke the memory of the [1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1963_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1963 Pittsburgh Steelers season\")– [1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1964 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only.\n\nIn 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their [1934 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1934_Pittsburgh_Pirates_(NFL)_season \"1934 Pittsburgh Pirates (NFL) season\"). The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal striped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the \"bumblebee jerseys\" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.[\\[103\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-a901-104)\n\nAlso in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black _[Color Rush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Color_Rush \"NFL Color Rush\")_ uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants.\n\nIn 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed.[\\[104\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-105)\n\nIn 1979, the team owners were approached by then- [Iowa Hawkeyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes_football \"Iowa Hawkeyes football\") Head Coach [Hayden Fry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Fry \"Hayden Fry\") about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers.[\\[105\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-b813-106) Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback [Terry Bradshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Bradshaw \"Terry Bradshaw\"). Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors.\n\n## Rivals\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division: ( [Cleveland Browns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns \"Cleveland Browns\"), [Baltimore Ravens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens \"Baltimore Ravens\"), and [Cincinnati Bengals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals \"Cincinnati Bengals\")). They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the [Las Vegas Raiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders \"Las Vegas Raiders\"), [Dallas Cowboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\"), [Denver Broncos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos \"Denver Broncos\"), [New England Patriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\"), and [Tennessee Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans \"Tennessee Titans\"). They also have an intrastate [rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Eagles–Steelers rivalry\") with the [Philadelphia Eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles \"Philadelphia Eagles\"), but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years.[\\[106\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-107)[\\[107\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-108)[\\[108\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-109)\n\n### Divisional rivals\n\n#### Cleveland Browns\n\nMain article: [Browns–Steelers rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browns%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Browns–Steelers rivalry\")\n\nThe Steelers and [Cleveland Browns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns \"Cleveland Browns\") have been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9–31 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66–27–1 (including 42–6 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75–58–1;[\\[109\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-110) The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009. Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970–85) and 15 (2004–present) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach [Bill Cowher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cowher \"Bill Cowher\") coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following [Marty Schottenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Schottenheimer \"Marty Schottenheimer\") for a brief tenure as [Kansas City Chiefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs \"Kansas City Chiefs\") defensive coordinator and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met three times in the postseason (1994, 2002, and 2021) with the Steelers winning the first two meetings, but losing the most recent in 2021.[\\[110\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-111)[\\[111\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-112)\n\n#### Baltimore Ravens\n\nMain article: [Ravens–Steelers rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravens%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Ravens–Steelers rivalry\")\n\nPittsburgh's rivalry with the [Baltimore Ravens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens \"Baltimore Ravens\") has had several memorable matchups and has escalated into a fierce divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home stadiums. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at [Baltimore's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore,_Maryland \"Baltimore, Maryland\") [M&T Bank Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%26T_Bank_Stadium \"M&T Bank Stadium\") in [1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_NFL_season \"1998 NFL season\"), 20–13, and three years later the [Ravens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens \"Baltimore Ravens\") handed the Steelers their first-ever loss at [Heinz Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Field \"Heinz Field\"), 13–10. Later that season ( [2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_NFL_season \"2001 NFL season\")) Pittsburgh won a [divisional playoff game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_NFL_playoffs#AFC:_Pittsburgh_Steelers_27,_Baltimore_Ravens_10 \"2001–02 NFL playoffs\") 27–10 against Baltimore, who was the [defending Super Bowl champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXV \"Super Bowl XXXV\"). During their NFL championship season in [2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Baltimore_Ravens_season \"2000 Baltimore Ravens season\"), the Ravens defeated the Steelers [in Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\"), 16–0, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9–6, in Baltimore (the Ravens' final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 32–24.[\\[112\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-113) The teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3–1 record.[\\[113\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-j269-114)\n\n#### Cincinnati Bengals\n\nMain article: [Bengals–Steelers rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengals%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Bengals–Steelers rivalry\")\n\nThe Steelers' rivalry with the [Cincinnati Bengals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals \"Cincinnati Bengals\") dates from the [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1970 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") season, when the [AFL–NFL merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93NFL_merger \"AFL–NFL merger\") was completed. In [1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"), the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7–3 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the [2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_NFL_playoffs#AFC:_Pittsburgh_Steelers_31,_Cincinnati_Bengals_17 \"2005–06 NFL playoffs\"), in which the Steelers, en route to a [Super Bowl title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XL \"Super Bowl XL\"), won a 31–17 come-from-behind victory after [Bengals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals \"Cincinnati Bengals\") quarterback [Carson Palmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Palmer \"Carson Palmer\") was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle [Kimo von Oelhoffen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimo_von_Oelhoffen \"Kimo von Oelhoffen\") contacted Palmer's knee during a passing play.[\\[114\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-115) The Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit. The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") season 38–31, and wide receiver [T. J. Houshmandzadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Houshmandzadeh \"T. J. Houshmandzadeh\") used a [Terrible Towel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrible_Towel \"Terrible Towel\") to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_NFL_season \"2005 NFL season\") and [2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_NFL_season \"2006 NFL season\") with identical records (11–5 and 8–8 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") and taking them out of contention in [2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2006 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"). The rivalry has become more intense again since the [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2015 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker [Vontaze Burfict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vontaze_Burfict \"Vontaze Burfict\"), often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18–16 Steelers comeback victory.[\\[61\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-ChrisBurke-61) The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63–35.[\\[115\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-116) The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times.[\\[116\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-117)\n\n### Conference\n\n#### New England Patriots\n\nMain article: [Patriots–Steelers rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriots%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Patriots–Steelers rivalry\")\n\nThe [New England Patriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\") emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 [AFC Championship Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game \"AFC Championship Game\") at [Heinz Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Field \"Heinz Field\"), though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in [1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_New_England_Patriots_season \"1996 New England Patriots season\") 28–3 while the Steelers won 7–6 in [1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1997 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"); both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in [Ty Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Law \"Ty Law\") and [Curtis Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Martin \"Curtis Martin\"). Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival [New York Jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_New_York_Jets_season \"1998 New York Jets season\"). Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30–14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the [2004 NFL season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_NFL_season \"2004 NFL season\"). Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15–1 regular season.\n\nThe Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period ( [1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_NFL_season \"1998 NFL season\")– [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_NFL_season \"2007 NFL season\")) before the Steelers broke through with a 33–10 victory at [Foxborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillette_Stadium \"Gillette Stadium\") in [2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_NFL_season \"2008 NFL season\"), after [Matt Cassel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Cassel \"Matt Cassel\") turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2013 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55–31. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28–21) and 2016's regular season (27–16) and then won 36–17 in the 2016 [AFC Championship Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game \"AFC Championship Game\"). They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end [Jesse James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_James_(tight_end) \"Jesse James (tight end)\") was controversially called back.[\\[117\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-118) Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17–10 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135–75, with the Patriots maintaining a 4–1 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the [Los Angeles Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers \"Los Angeles Chargers\") (2–1), the [Jacksonville Jaguars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Jacksonville_Jaguars_season \"2007 Jacksonville Jaguars season\") (2–0), and the Denver Broncos (5–3). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15–13 against the Patriots.[\\[118\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-119) In the [Bill Belichick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick \"Bill Belichick\") era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12–4 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33–3 on [Sunday Night Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sunday_Night_Football \"NBC Sunday Night Football\").\n\n#### Tennessee Titans\n\nMain article: [Steelers–Titans rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelers%E2%80%93Titans_rivalry \"Steelers–Titans rivalry\")\n\nThe Steelers have a rivalry with the [Tennessee Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans \"Tennessee Titans\"), formerly the [Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Oilers \"Houston Oilers\")/Tennessee Oilers. The Oilers were aligned into the [AFC Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Central \"AFC Central\") with the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34–31 playoff showdown in [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2002 Pittsburgh Steelers season\")); the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997–2001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series. The Steelers have won 47 of 79 career meetings following their 27–24 win at [Nissan Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Stadium_(Nashville) \"Nissan Stadium (Nashville)\") in 2020.[\\[119\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-120)\n\n#### Denver Broncos\n\nMain article: [Broncos–Steelers rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broncos%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Broncos–Steelers rivalry\")\n\nThe [Denver Broncos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos \"Denver Broncos\") in 2011 broke a tie with the [Oakland Raiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Raiders \"Oakland Raiders\") for the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in 2015 (the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland's six). The Steelers' rivalry with the Broncos dates from [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1970 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"), but the first notable contest came in [1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1973 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"), when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at [Three Rivers Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\"), 23–13. The following year, they met in the NFL's first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35–35 tie. Denver's first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round; the Broncos won 34–21. The following year, the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver 33–10 in the divisional round. Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in [Mile High Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile_High_Stadium \"Mile High Stadium\"); the Steelers pulled the upset 24–17. They nearly pulled the upset again 5 years later in Denver, but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff, 24–23.\n\nIn 1997, the two teams met in [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh \"Pittsburgh\") for the [AFC Championship Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game \"AFC Championship Game\"), where Denver squeaked out at 24–21 win.[\\[120\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-121) Eight years later, the Steelers advanced to [Super Bowl XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XL \"Super Bowl XL\") by beating Denver 34–17 in Colorado. In 2011, after appearing in [Super Bowl XLV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLV \"Super Bowl XLV\"), the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as [AFC Champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference \"American Football Conference\") dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the [Tim Tebow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow \"Tim Tebow\")-led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the \"316 game\". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31–19 in [Peyton Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning \"Peyton Manning\")'s [debut as Broncos quarterback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Denver_Broncos_season \"2012 Denver Broncos season\"). The two clubs met twice in [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2015 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"), as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; through the 2021 season, Denver leads the series 20–13–1, including 5–3 in the playoffs.[\\[121\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-122) Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row. In their last matchup, the Steelers beat the Broncos on October 10, 2021, in Pittsburgh by the score of 27–19.\n\n#### Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders\n\nMain article: [Raiders–Steelers rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Raiders–Steelers rivalry\")\n\nThe Steelers' rivalry with the Raiders was one of the most heated battles of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers' first playoff victory in franchise history came against the Raiders, which occurred on December 23, 1972, in a 13–7 victory over the Raiders; the victory occurred when [Terry Bradshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Bradshaw \"Terry Bradshaw\") threw a pass intended for [John Fuqua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fuqua \"John Fuqua\") that was deflected into the hands of [Franco Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Harris \"Franco Harris\"), who scooped the ball from nearly hitting the ground and carried the ball in for a touchdown, which was later referred to as the [Immaculate Reception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_Reception \"Immaculate Reception\"), while attracting controversy from Raiders players and coaches, who alleged that the ball had bounced off Fuqua, which would have made it an illegal play per the rules of the time.[\\[122\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-123) The victory sent Pittsburgh to their first-ever AFC Championship Game. The following year, the two teams met in the Divisional Round again, and the Raiders responded with a 33–14 victory to advance to the AFC title game. However, Pittsburgh fired back with two straight AFC Championship victories over the Raiders in [1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_NFL_season \"1974 NFL season\") (24–13) and [1975](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_NFL_season \"1975 NFL season\") (16–10) to reach the [Super Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\"). The Raiders responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the [1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_NFL_season \"1976 NFL season\") AFC Championship game 24–7 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before [Chuck Noll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Noll \"Chuck Noll\") referred to Raider [George Atkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Atkinson_(safety) \"George Atkinson (safety)\") as part of the NFL's \"criminal element\" after his alleged cheap-shot on [Lynn Swann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Swann \"Lynn Swann\") during a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a [defamation of character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation_of_character \"Defamation of character\") [lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit \"Lawsuit\") against Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38–10 in the AFC Divisional round, which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback [Terry Bradshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Bradshaw \"Terry Bradshaw\"), who did not play due to injury.\n\nWhile the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to the Raiders decline after [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Oakland_Raiders_season \"2002 Oakland Raiders season\")), the teams have had notable games against each other, including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the [2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2000 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the [2006 NFL season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_NFL_season \"2006 NFL season\") (20–13), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth. In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened; the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB [Bruce Gradkowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Gradkowski \"Bruce Gradkowski\")'s third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27–24 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Field \"Heinz Field\") in [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"), where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35–3, and ended their 3-game winning streak; the game was further notable for a punch thrown by [Richard Seymour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Seymour \"Richard Seymour\") of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback [Ben Roethlisberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Roethlisberger \"Ben Roethlisberger\"). The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Oakland_Raiders_season \"2012 Oakland Raiders season\") and erased a 31–21 gap to win 34–31. The two clubs met again in [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_NFL_season \"2013 NFL season\") and the Raiders won again, 21–18. In 2015, the Steelers defeated the Raiders 38–35 at Heinz Field.\n\nOn December 9, 2018, in Oakland, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 24–21, which, ironically, would cost Pittsburgh another playoff berth.[\\[123\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-124) The Raiders won at Pittsburgh on September 19, 2021, 26–17, then fell on [Christmas Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Eve \"Christmas Eve\") 2022 at Pittsburgh 13–10 on a last-minute touchdown by rookie Steelers quarterback [Kenny Pickett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Pickett \"Kenny Pickett\"). A lifeless performance in a 23–18 loss at Vegas on September 23, 2023, contributed to the later firing of Raiders coach [Josh McDaniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McDaniels \"Josh McDaniels\") and GM [Dave Ziegler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Ziegler \"Dave Ziegler\"). As of the 2024 season, the Raiders lead the all-time series 17–16.[\\[124\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-125)\n\n### Interconference\n\n#### Dallas Cowboys\n\nMain article: [Cowboys–Steelers rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboys%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Cowboys–Steelers rivalry\")\n\nThe Steelers once took part in a historic rivalry with the [Dallas Cowboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys \"Dallas Cowboys\")[\\[125\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-126) started with the Cowboys' first game as a franchise in [1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_NFL_season \"1960 NFL season\") (against the Steelers) at the [Cotton Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_(stadium) \"Cotton Bowl (stadium)\") with the Steelers coming away with a 35–28 victory. These teams hold a record for the most times (three) that two teams have met in a [Super Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\"). The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl [Super Bowl X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_X \"Super Bowl X\") 21–17 and [Super Bowl XIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XIII \"Super Bowl XIII\") 35–31. The Cowboys never won a regular-season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers). Between the Cowboys and Steelers, Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating, which as of 2021 numbered 25 – 16 players and nine coaches/front office, including [Ernie Stautner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Stautner \"Ernie Stautner\"), [defensive coordinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator \"Defensive coordinator\") for the Cowboys who was a HoF [defensive tackle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle \"Defensive tackle\") for the Steelers. The teams featured an all-star matchup at quarterback between the Steelers' [Terry Bradshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Bradshaw \"Terry Bradshaw\") and the Cowboys' [Roger Staubach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Staubach \"Roger Staubach\"), both of whom are in the [Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame \"Pro Football Hall of Fame\"). In [1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_NFL_season \"1977 NFL season\"), Staubach and the Cowboys won [Super Bowl XII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XII \"Super Bowl XII\"), their second and last loss of their season being inflicted by Bradshaw and the Steelers, 28–13 at Three Rivers Stadium in November. In [1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_NFL_season \"1979 NFL season\"), Staubach's final season, the two defending conference champs met again at Three Rivers, the Steelers winning 14–3 en route to winning their [fourth Super Bowl title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XIV \"Super Bowl XIV\"). The Steelers won six of eight meetings during the 1970s and 80s, before the Cowboys won all four meetings during the 1990s, including the teams' record third Super Bowl meeting in [1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXX \"Super Bowl XXX\"), as this time the heavily favored Cowboys beat the Steelers 27–17. Dallas cornerback [Larry Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Brown_(cornerback) \"Larry Brown (cornerback)\") intercepted Pittsburgh quarterback [Neil O'Donnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_O%27Donnell \"Neil O'Donnell\") twice and was named the game's MVP.

The all-time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys, 17–16.[\\[126\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-127) The Pittsburgh/Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the 1977 film _[Black Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sunday_(1977_film) \"Black Sunday (1977 film)\")_, parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X. Most recently, the Steelers beat the Cowboys by a 24–19 margin.\n\n#### Philadelphia Eagles\n\nMain article: [Eagles–Steelers rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Eagles–Steelers rivalry\")\n\nThe [Philadelphia Eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles \"Philadelphia Eagles\") and Steelers are both located in [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania \"Pennsylvania\") and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the [Cleveland Browns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns \"Cleveland Browns\") and [Baltimore Colts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Colts \"Baltimore Colts\")) moved to the [American Football Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference \"American Football Conference\"), while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the [National Football Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference \"National Football Conference\"). As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2024 at Lincoln Financial Field, a game in which the Eagles won 27–13. The Steelers have lost 11 straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the [Super Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\") era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 50–29–3.[\\[127\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-128)\n\n## Culture\n\n### Mascot\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/SteelyMcBeam.jpg/250px-SteelyMcBeam.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SteelyMcBeam.jpg) Steely McBeam signing autographs for fans at Steelers training camp on August 2, 2007\n\nPrior to the [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2007 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") season, the Steelers introduced Steely McBeam as their official mascot.[\\[128\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-CatchingUp-129) As part of the 75th anniversary celebrations of the team, his name was selected from a pool of 70,000 suggestions submitted by fans of the team.[\\[128\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-CatchingUp-129) Diane Roles of [Middlesex Township](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesex_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania \"Middlesex Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania\"), submitted the winning name which was \"meant to represent steel for Pittsburgh's industrial heritage, \"Mc\" for the Rooney family's Irish roots, and Beam for the steel beams produced in Pittsburgh, as well as for [Jim Beam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Beam \"Jim Beam\"), her husband's favorite alcoholic beverage.\"[\\[129\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-Name-130) Steely McBeam is visible at all home games and participates in the team's charitable programs and other club-sponsored events.[\\[128\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-CatchingUp-129) Steely's autograph is known to be drawn with an oversized _S_, and the _L_ is drawn to look like a beam of steel.[\\[128\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-CatchingUp-129)\n\n### Fanbase\n\nMain article: [Steeler Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steeler_Nation \"Steeler Nation\")\n\nThe Steelers have a tradition of having a large fanbase, which has spread from Pittsburgh.
