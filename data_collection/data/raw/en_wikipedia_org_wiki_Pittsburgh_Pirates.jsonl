For the minor league team, see [Pittsburgh Allegheny (International Association)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Allegheny_(International_Association) \"Pittsburgh Allegheny (International Association)\").\n\n| Pittsburgh Pirates |\n\nThe **Pittsburgh Pirates** are an American professional [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball \"Baseball\") team based in [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh \"Pittsburgh\"). The Pirates compete in [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball \"Major League Baseball\") (MLB) as a member club of the [National League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball) \"National League (baseball)\") (NL) [Central Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central \"National League Central\"). Founded as part of the [American Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_(19th_century) \"American Association (19th century)\") in 1881 under the name the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the [National League East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East \"National League East\") from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series \"World Series\") championships, nine [National League pennants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_League_pennant_winners \"List of National League pennant winners\"), nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the [Wild Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Wild_Card_Game \"Major League Baseball Wild Card Game\").\n\nThe Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the [inaugural World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1903_World_Series \"1903 World Series\") in 1903 and winning their first title in [1909](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1909_World_Series \"1909 World Series\") behind [Honus Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honus_Wagner \"Honus Wagner\"). The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the [1960 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_World_Series \"1960 World Series\") against the [New York Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees \"New York Yankees\") on a [walk-off home run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run \"Walk-off home run\") by [Bill Mazeroski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mazeroski \"Bill Mazeroski\"), the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in [1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_World_Series \"1971 World Series\") behind [Roberto Clemente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Clemente \"Roberto Clemente\"), the first Latin-American enshrined in the [National Baseball Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame \"National Baseball Hall of Fame\"), and in [1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_World_Series \"1979 World Series\") under the leadership of [Willie Stargell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Stargell \"Willie Stargell\").\n\nSince their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from [1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"1993 Pittsburgh Pirates season\") to [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"2012 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-5)\nThe Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League,[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-6) and the longest [League Championship Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_Championship_Series \"League Championship Series\") appearance and division championship drought in all of baseball. From 1882 to 2025, the Pirates have an overall record of 10,910–10,910–140 (.500 winning 'percentage').[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-7)\n\nThe Pirates are also often referred to as the \"Bucs\" or the \"Buccos\" (derived from [buccaneer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buccaneer \"Buccaneer\"), a synonym for [pirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy \"Piracy\")). Since 2001 the team has played its home games at [PNC Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park \"PNC Park\"), a 39,000-seat stadium along the [Allegheny River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_River \"Allegheny River\") in Pittsburgh's [North Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Side_(Pittsburgh) \"North Side (Pittsburgh)\"). The Pirates previously played at [Forbes Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Field \"Forbes Field\") from 1909 to 1970 and at [Three Rivers Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\") from 1970 to 2000. Since 1948 the Pirates' colors have been black, gold and white, derived from the [flag of Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Pittsburgh \"Flag of Pittsburgh\") and matching the other major professional sports teams in Pittsburgh, the [Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\") and the [Penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins \"Pittsburgh Penguins\").\n\n## History\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh_Pirates&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")\\]\n\nMain article: [History of the Pittsburgh Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Pittsburgh_Pirates \"History of the Pittsburgh Pirates\")\n\nProfessional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the [Allegheny Base Ball Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Allegheny_(International_Association) \"Pittsburgh Allegheny (International Association)\"), an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called [Allegheny City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny,_Pennsylvania \"Allegheny, Pennsylvania\"), across the [Allegheny River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_River \"Allegheny River\") from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league [International Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_for_Professional_Base_Ball_Players \"International Association for Professional Base Ball Players\") in 1877, only to fold the following season.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-8) On October 15, 1881, [Denny McKnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_McKnight \"Denny McKnight\") held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club,[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-9) which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the [American Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_(19th_century) \"American Association (19th century)\"). Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh,[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-10) the team was listed as \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \"Alleghenys\" (occasionally the \"Alleghenies\" or “Allies”) in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mostly mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first [A.A. team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_North_American_professional_sports_teams \"Major North American professional sports teams\") to switch to the older [National League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball) \"National League (baseball)\") in 1887.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-11)\n\nDuring the winter prior to the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the [Players' League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Players%27_League \"Players' League\")'s [Pittsburgh Burghers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Burghers \"Pittsburgh Burghers\"). The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also signed highly regarded second baseman [Lou Bierbauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Bierbauer \"Lou Bierbauer\"), who had previously played with the A.A.'s [Philadelphia Athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics_(American_Association) \"Philadelphia Athletics (American Association)\"). Although the Athletics failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was \"piratical\".[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-12) This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly \"piratical\" act gained them the occasional nickname \"Pirates\" from newspapers around the country, starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with even Pittsburgh newspapers.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-13) The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912.\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/1909_Pittsburgh_Pirates_on_a_boat_FINAL.jpg/250px-1909_Pittsburgh_Pirates_on_a_boat_FINAL.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1909_Pittsburgh_Pirates_on_a_boat_FINAL.jpg) The [1909 Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1909_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"1909 Pittsburgh Pirates season\") in a poster celebrating their National League pennant.

The Pirates acquired several star players from the [Louisville Colonels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Colonels \"Louisville Colonels\"), who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.)[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-TBT-14) Among those players was [Honus Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honus_Wagner \"Honus Wagner\"), who would become one of the first players inducted to the [Baseball Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame \"Baseball Hall of Fame\"). The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating in [the first modern World Series ever played](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1903_World_Series \"1903 World Series\"), which they lost to [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1903_Boston_Americans_season \"1903 Boston Americans season\"). The Pirates returned to the World Series in [1909](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1909_World_Series \"1909 World Series\"), defeating the [Detroit Tigers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1909_Detroit_Tigers_season \"1909 Detroit Tigers season\") for their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from [Exposition Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_Park_(Pittsburgh) \"Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)\") to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, [Forbes Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Field \"Forbes Field\").\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/World_Series_program_%281927%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Series_program_(1927).jpg) 1927 World Series program\n\nAs Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51–103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder [Max Carey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Carey \"Max Carey\") and young players [Pie Traynor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_Traynor \"Pie Traynor\") and [Kiki Cuyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_Cuyler \"Kiki Cuyler\"), along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in [1925](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1925_World_Series \"1925 World Series\"), becoming the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit in the World Series.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-15) The Pirates returned to the World Series in [1927](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1927_World_Series \"1927 World Series\") but were swept by the [Murderer's Row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murderer%27s_Row \"Murderer's Row\") [Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees \"New York Yankees\"). The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the [Chicago Cubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs \"Chicago Cubs\") in the [final week of the season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_in_the_Gloamin%27 \"Homer in the Gloamin'\").\n\nDespite the prowess of [Ralph Kiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Kiner \"Ralph Kiner\") as a slugger during the latter half of the stretch, the Pirates were mostly undistinguished in the 1940s, and downright awful in the early 1950s. [Branch Rickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_Rickey \"Branch Rickey\") was brought in during this time to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in [1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_World_Series \"1960 World Series\"). They were largely outscored over the course of the series by the [Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_New_York_Yankees_season \"1960 New York Yankees season\"), yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by [Bill Mazeroski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mazeroski \"Bill Mazeroski\") in the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2024, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history.\n\nLed by right fielder [Roberto Clemente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Clemente \"Roberto Clemente\"), the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until [1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_World_Series \"1971 World Series\"). Playing in the new [Three Rivers Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\"), the Pirates defeated the favored [Baltimore Orioles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Baltimore_Orioles_season \"1971 Baltimore Orioles season\") behind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of [Steve Blass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Blass \"Steve Blass\"). In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup.[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-16)\nDespite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created [National League East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East \"National League East\") in [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"1970 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), [1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"1971 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), [1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"1972 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), [1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"1974 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), [1975](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"1975 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), and [1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"1979 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"). Powered by sluggers such as [Willie Stargell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Stargell \"Willie Stargell\"), [Dave Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Parker \"Dave Parker\"), and [Al Oliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Oliver \"Al Oliver\"), the team was nicknamed \"The Lumber Company.\" Behind Stargell's leadership and the [disco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco \"Disco\") song [\"We Are Family\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_Family_(song) \"We Are Family (song)\") (which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3–1 deficit to once again defeat the [Orioles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_Baltimore_Orioles_season \"1979 Baltimore Orioles season\") in the [1979 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_World_Series \"1979 World Series\") for the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis).\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f6/Pirates1989.jpg/250px-Pirates1989.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pirates1989.jpg) Pittsburgh clinching the division title in 1990.\n\nThe Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like [Barry Bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Bonds \"Barry Bonds\"), [Bobby Bonilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Bonilla \"Bobby Bonilla\"), and [Doug Drabek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Drabek \"Doug Drabek\"). The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the [National League Championship Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series \"National League Championship Series\") each time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_National_League_Championship_Series \"1992 National League Championship Series\"). Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season.\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Andrew_McCutchen_on_June_12%2C_2012.jpg/250px-Andrew_McCutchen_on_June_12%2C_2012.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Andrew_McCutchen_on_June_12,_2012.jpg) [Andrew McCutchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCutchen \"Andrew McCutchen\"), 2012\n\nWith salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001, [PNC Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park \"PNC Park\"), did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"2013 Pittsburgh Pirates season\") behind National League MVP [Andrew McCutchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCutchen \"Andrew McCutchen\"), defeating the [Cincinnati Reds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Cincinnati_Reds_season \"2013 Cincinnati Reds season\") in the [Wild Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_National_League_Wild_Card_Game \"2013 National League Wild Card Game\"). They were eliminated in five games in the [next round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_National_League_Division_Series \"2013 National League Division Series\") by the [St. Louis Cardinals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals \"St. Louis Cardinals\"). That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time wins.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-17) On [Opening Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Day \"Opening Day\") 2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-Wilmoth,_Charlie_2015-18) making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the [Philadelphia Phillies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies \"Philadelphia Phillies\"), [Atlanta Braves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves \"Atlanta Braves\"), and the Chicago Cubs.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-19) The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then.\n\n## Ballpark\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh_Pirates&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Ballpark\")\\]\n\nSince 2001, the Pirates have played their home games at [PNC Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park \"PNC Park\"), located on the banks of the [Allegheny River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_River \"Allegheny River\") in Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The park was built as a replacement for the aging [Three Rivers Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\"), a dual-purpose stadium that had been designed for functionality rather than aesthetics.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-OnDeck-20) Funded mainly through taxpayer money, the ballpark cost $216 million to construct and is named for Pittsburgh-based [PNC Financial Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Financial_Services \"PNC Financial Services\").[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-21) PNC Park's listed capacity is 38,747 for baseball, although standing-room only space can accommodate more than 40,000 fans; the biggest crowd in stadium history was the [2015 National League Wild Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_National_League_Wild_Card_Game \"2015 National League Wild Card Game\"), when 40,889 fans saw the Cubs defeat the Pirates 4–0.\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/PNC_Park_%2816190813495%29.jpg/250px-PNC_Park_%2816190813495%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PNC_Park_(16190813495).jpg) PNC Park prior to a game in 2014\n\nWidely considered to be among the best baseball stadiums in the country, several outlets have praised PNC Park for its location, limestone and steel façade, and views of both the action on the field and the Pittsburgh skyline.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-kdka15-22)[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-wapo2017-23)[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-24)[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-25) PNC Park was the first two-deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953;[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-ESPN-26) as a result, fans in the upper deck are closer to the action than at most ballparks, with the highest seat in the stadium 88 feet (27 m) above the playing surface. Fans in the lower deck are also closer to the field: the batter is closer to the seats behind home plate than to the pitcher,[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-27) and seating along the baselines is 45 feet from the bases at their closest point. A four-level steel rotunda down the left field line offers extensive standing room only space, and action on the field can be seen from the first-level concourse. PNC Park has a reputation as a pitcher's park, with a deep left field that juts out to more than 410 feet from home plate. Right field is closer, but the wall is 21 feet high, nicknamed the Clemente Wall after former right-fielder [Roberto Clemente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Clemente \"Roberto Clemente\"), who wore number 21. Statutes of Clemente, [Willie Stargell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Stargell \"Willie Stargell\"), [Bill Mazeroski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mazeroski \"Bill Mazeroski\") and [Honus Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honus_Wagner \"Honus Wagner\") are located at several entrances to the stadium. In addition to hosting Pirate games, PNC Park hosted the [2006 MLB All-Star Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_MLB_All-Star_Game \"2006 MLB All-Star Game\") and has been the site of several concerts.\n\nPNC Park is located near several major highways and parking is available in the blocks around the ballpark. Fans can also walk to the stadium from [downtown Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Pittsburgh \"Downtown Pittsburgh\") via the [Clemente Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemente_Bridge \"Clemente Bridge\"), or take [Pittsburgh Light Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Light_Rail \"Pittsburgh Light Rail\") to the system's [North Side station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Side_station_(Pittsburgh_Regional_Transit) \"North Side station (Pittsburgh Regional Transit)\"), located just outside the stadium's home plate entrance.\n\n### Former ballparks\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh_Pirates&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Former ballparks\")\\]\n\nThe Pirates' first home was [Exposition Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_Park_(Pittsburgh) \"Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)\"), located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and [Recreation Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreation_Park_(Pittsburgh) \"Recreation Park (Pittsburgh)\"), which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the middle of the 1909 season.[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-28) The park hosted the [first modern World Series ever played](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1903_World_Series \"1903 World Series\") in 1903, but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920.[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-29) The site, currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, is marked by a state historical marker (near the intersection of West Gen.

Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete ballpark in the nation.[\\[30\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-30) Forbes Field was expanded several times over the decades, with capacity almost doubled from its initial 23,000 in 1909 to 41,000 in 1925 (although it was reduced to 35,000 in its later years). Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss \"hated cheap [home runs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run \"Home run\") and vowed he'd have none in his park\", which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field.[\\[31\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-31) When a large grandstand was constructed down the right field line in the early 1920s, reducing the distance to 300 feet from home plate, Dreyfuss had a 28-foot screen erected.[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-32)[\\[33\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-33)[\\[34\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-34) Despite this, Forbes Field is remembered for several famous home runs: the final three homers of [Babe Ruth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babe_Ruth \"Babe Ruth\")'s career on May 25, 1935[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-Dia90-35) and Bill Mazeroski's championship-winning blast in Game 7 of the [1960 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_World_Series \"1960 World Series\"). The park also hosted [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football \"American football\") games for the [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\") and [University of Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh \"University of Pittsburgh\") [\"Pitt\" Panthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Panthers_football \"Pittsburgh Panthers football\"). Located in a sparsely populated area of the city when it opened in 1909, by the 1960s Forbes Field was surrounded by the University of Pittsburgh campus. The Pirates left the ballpark midway through the 1970 season and the stadium was demolished the following year. Sections of the outfield wall remain standing along Roberto Clemente Drive, and the home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's [Posvar Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_W._Posvar_Hall \"Wesley W.

Like other [multi-purpose stadiums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-purpose_stadium \"Multi-purpose stadium\") popular at the time, Three Rivers featured extensive box seats, a turf playing field, and moveable seating sections to accommodate both football and baseball. Three Rivers ended up being much better suited for the former than the latter, and the Pirates struggled to draw fans despite their on-field success in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the Pirates were threatening to leave Pittsburgh unless a new, baseball-only stadium was constructed. The Pirates played their final game at Three Rivers on October 1, 2000, and the stadium was demolished the following winter. The site is currently occupied by parking lots and [Stage AE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_AE \"Stage AE\"), although one of the stadium's entrance markers remains standing near [Acrisure Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrisure_Stadium \"Acrisure Stadium\").

Like other teams in Major League Baseball, the Pirates predominantly favored a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme through the first half of the 20th Century.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-sportslogos.net-43) During this time, the Pirates predominantly wore a blue cap, with either a red or white P. The uniforms were plain, often including a simple \"P\" if anything at all. The team's name was first acknowledged in 1912, with a pinstripe jersey that had \"Pirates\" running vertically down the placket.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-sportslogos.net-43) The team's name would not appear on the club's uniforms again until they were added to the road uniforms in 1933, this time written horizontally in a more ornate style. An image of a pirate's head appeared on the home and road jerseys for the 1940 and 1941 seasons (this image would be reused for the team's logo in the 1980s and 1990s), and \"Pittsburgh\" first appeared on the road uniforms in 1942.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-sportslogos.net-43)\n\nIn 1948, the team broke away from the patriotic \"Red, White, & Blue\" color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of the [Flag of Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Pittsburgh \"Flag of Pittsburgh\") and, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively unknown [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\") of the [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\"). The Pirates had made a similar change to black and gold in 1924,[\\[44\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-44)[\\[45\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-45)[\\[46\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-46) but the change did not last beyond that season.[\\[47\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-47)[\\[48\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-48) Along with the [San Francisco Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants \"San Francisco Giants\"), the Pirates are one of two pre-expansion [National League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball) \"National League (baseball)\") teams that completely changed their colors, although red returned as an \"accent color\" in 1997 and remained until 2009.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by the team (the honor goes to the [Cincinnati Reds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds \"Cincinnati Reds\")), the Pirates helped popularize the look. Coinciding with the move into [Three Rivers Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium \"Three Rivers Stadium\") in 1970, the team switched to a darker shade of gold and changed their caps from black to gold with a black brim; they also introduced pullover nylon/cotton jerseys and beltless pants as part of their new uniform set (later to become polyester doubleknit).[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-sportslogos.net-43) The Pirates became the first team in baseball to sport such a look, but it quickly became popular throughout the league, and the pullover style would become the prominent look of 1970s and 1980s baseball. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch.\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Fred_Rogers_and_Willie_Stargell.jpg/250px-Fred_Rogers_and_Willie_Stargell.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fred_Rogers_and_Willie_Stargell.jpg) [Willie Stargell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Stargell \"Willie Stargell\") wearing the black top and gold pants combo, posing with Pittsburgh native [Fred Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers \"Fred Rogers\")\n\nIn 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal [pinstripes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinstripes \"Pinstripes\"). After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-sportslogos.net-43) The Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wear [third jerseys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_jersey \"Third jersey\"), following the [Oakland Athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics \"Oakland Athletics\"). Starting in [1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"1977 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The pants, tops and caps could all be worn interchangeably for different looks; the Pirates wore four different uniform combinations in the [1979 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_World_Series \"1979 World Series\"). The pinstripes came off the white uniforms in 1980, but the Pirates continued to utilize the three uniform set until the 1985 season, when the team returned to the straightforward home whites/road grays combination. The solid black cap with a gold \"P\" returned in 1987 and has been the team's primary cap ever since.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-sportslogos.net-43)\n\nAfter [Kevin McClatchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McClatchy \"Kevin McClatchy\") purchased the team in 1996, the Pirates added a third jersey and utilized red as an accent color, including red brims on the team's caps. A sleeveless white jersey with pinstripes was worn as an alternate home jersey from 2005 to 2010, and a red alternate jersey was added for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"2009 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), the Pirates began wearing an alternate black jersey with a gold \"P\" at both home and on the road.[\\[43\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-sportslogos.net-43) From 2013 to 2019, the Pirates wore throwback uniforms for Sunday home games: the early 70s pullover uniforms from 2013 to 2015, and the gold top/black pants from the late 70s from 2016 to 2019.[\\[49\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-49)\n\nSince the [2015 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"2015 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), the Pirates have worn an alternate camo jersey for select home games.[\\[50\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-50) The camouflage alternates were updated for the [2018 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"2018 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), now white with camo green wordmarks, numbers, piping, and patches.[\\[51\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-51)\n\nAhead of the [2020 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"2020 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), the Pirates revived the script \"Pittsburgh\" wordmarks on their gray road and new black alternate road jerseys, which were unveiled on January 24, 2020. Script wordmarks had previously been seen on the road jerseys from 1990 until 2000. The alternate road jersey also features a Pirate wearing a re-colored bandana, yellow to match the theme of the jersey, and is worn with a black cap featuring the \"P\" logo outlined in black and yellow.[\\[52\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-52) In addition to these road uniforms, the Pirates continue to wear their white uniforms, the black alternate with the gold \"P\", and the camo alternate for games played at PNC Park.\n\nIn 2023, the Pirates retired the camo home alternate to comply with the new \"4+1\" rule, restricting teams to a home, away, two alternate uniforms and a [City Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Connect \"City Connect\") uniform. The Pirates continued to wear the camo cap on occasion with the home white uniform. They also unveiled their City Connect uniform, featuring a gold top and black pants with a gold \"P\" cap with black brim. The jersey itself features the abbreviation of Pittsburgh \"PGH\". A closer look of the jersey feature the Three Elements.

While the Pirates and Tigers only became \"natural rivals\" because the other AL and NL Central teams were already paired up, it has become popular with fans of both teams, possibly due to the rivalry between the [National Hockey League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League \"National Hockey League\")'s [Detroit Red Wings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Red_Wings \"Detroit Red Wings\") and [Pittsburgh Penguins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins \"Pittsburgh Penguins\").

The Tigers' AA Minor League affiliate, the [Erie SeaWolves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_SeaWolves \"Erie SeaWolves\"), located near Pittsburgh, is a former affiliate of the Pirates and has retained the logo of a wolf wearing a pirate bandanna and eye patch. Additionally, Jim Leyland, former manager of both the Pirates (1986–1996) and the Tigers (2005–2013), remains popular in Pittsburgh where he resides. The Pirates led the regular-season series, 36–29. The two teams played in the [1909 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1909_World_Series \"1909 World Series\").\n\nAn on-and-off rivalry with the [Cleveland Guardians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians \"Cleveland Guardians\") stems from the close proximity of both cities, and features some carryover elements from the [longstanding rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browns%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Browns–Steelers rivalry\") in the [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League \"National Football League\") between the [Cleveland Browns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns \"Cleveland Browns\") and [Pittsburgh Steelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers \"Pittsburgh Steelers\"). Because the Guardians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' designated rival is the Tigers, the teams have only played periodically. The teams played one three-game series each year from 1997 to 2001 and periodically between 2002 and 2022, generally only in years in which the AL Central played the NL Central in the former interleague play rotation. The teams played six games in 2020 as MLB instituted an abbreviated schedule focusing on regional match-ups. Beginning in 2023, the teams will play a three-game series each season as a result of the new \"balanced\" schedule. The Pirates lead the series 21–19.[\\[64\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-64)\n\n## Roster\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh_Pirates&action=edit&section=11 \"Edit section: Roster\")\\]\n\n| Pittsburgh Pirates 2026 spring training roster |\n\n## Players of note\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh_Pirates&action=edit&section=12 \"Edit section: Players of note\")\\]\n\nSee also: [Pittsburgh Pirates award winners and league leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates_award_winners_and_league_leaders \"Pittsburgh Pirates award winners and league leaders\")\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Roberto_Clemente_1972_pirates.png/250px-Roberto_Clemente_1972_pirates.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Roberto_Clemente_1972_pirates.png) Hall of Famer [Roberto Clemente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Clemente \"Roberto Clemente\") collected 3,000 hits and was named [World Series MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series_MVP \"World Series MVP\") in 1971[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/RalphKiner1953bowman.jpg/250px-RalphKiner1953bowman.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RalphKiner1953bowman.jpg) Hall of Famer [Ralph Kiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Kiner \"Ralph Kiner\") led the NL in home runs for seven straight seasons (1946–1952)[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Bill_Mazeroski_-_Pittsburgh_Pirates_-_1966.jpg/250px-Bill_Mazeroski_-_Pittsburgh_Pirates_-_1966.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bill_Mazeroski_-_Pittsburgh_Pirates_-_1966.jpg) Hall of Famer [Bill Mazeroski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mazeroski \"Bill Mazeroski\") hit a ninth-inning walk-off home run that decided the 1960 World Series[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Willie_Stargell_-_Pittsburgh_Pirates.jpg/190px-Willie_Stargell_-_Pittsburgh_Pirates.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Willie_Stargell_-_Pittsburgh_Pirates.jpg) Hall of Famer [Willie Stargell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Stargell \"Willie Stargell\") was named [World Series MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series_MVP \"World Series MVP\") in 1979[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Honus_wagner_t206_baseball_card.jpg/250px-Honus_wagner_t206_baseball_card.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Honus_wagner_t206_baseball_card.jpg) [Honus Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honus_Wagner \"Honus Wagner\") is considered to be one of the greatest shortstops of all time and was a member of the [MLB Hall of Fame's Inaugural Class in 1936](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum#Inductees \"National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\").

The Pirates won the game, 8–5.\n- In [1925](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1925_World_Series \"1925 World Series\"), the Pirates became the first MLB team to recover from a 3-games-to-1 deficit in winning a best-of-seven World Series; they then became the first MLB team to repeat that feat in [1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_World_Series \"1979 World Series\").[\\[85\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-87)[\\[86\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-88)\n- During the 1953 season, the Pirates became the first team to permanently adopt batting helmets on both offense and defense. These helmets resembled a primitive fiberglass \" [miner's cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_miner \"Coal miner\")\". This was the mandate of general manager [Branch Rickey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_Rickey \"Branch Rickey\"), who also owned stock in the company producing the helmets. Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear the helmets both at bat and in the field. The helmets became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters, but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of helmets in the field, partly because of their awkward and heavy feel. Once the Pirates discarded the helmets on defense, the trend disappeared from the game.[\\[87\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-89) In 2014, Major League Baseball allowed pitchers to choose to wear a padded hat that aims to combine the added safety of a helmet with the comfort of a baseball cap.[\\[88\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-90) The cap would prove widely unpopular, with only [Alex Torres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Torres_(baseball) \"Alex Torres (baseball)\") of the [New York Mets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets \"New York Mets\") choosing to wear it.[\\[89\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-91)\n- First franchise to win a World Series on a [home run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run \"Walk-off home run\") ( [1960 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_World_Series \"1960 World Series\")) in the 7th game.

Upon the team ending their 20-season losing season streak with a winning season in [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"2013 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), the fan support for the club has grown once again but still remaining a distant third behind the city's other 2 more successful franchises in the last half-century.\n\nWhile the team's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the [Super Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl \"Super Bowl\") three times ( [XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XIV \"Super Bowl XIV\"), [XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XL \"Super Bowl XL\"), and [XLIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLIII \"Super Bowl XLIII\")) and the Penguins the [Stanley Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup \"Stanley Cup\") five times in [1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Stanley_Cup_Final \"1991 Stanley Cup Final\"), [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Stanley_Cup_Final \"1992 Stanley Cup Final\"), [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Stanley_Cup_Final \"2009 Stanley Cup Final\"), [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Stanley_Cup_Final \"2016 Stanley Cup Final\"), and [2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Stanley_Cup_Final \"2017 Stanley Cup Final\"), including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s,[\\[109\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-111) the [Pittsburgh drug trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_drug_trials \"Pittsburgh drug trials\") in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped.[\\[110\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-112) The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of [PNC Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park \"PNC Park\") in 2001.[\\[111\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-113) Following the [Andrew McCutchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCutchen \"Andrew McCutchen\") trade in 2018, fan relations have deteriorated despite the Pirates contending for the NL Central during 2018 due to backlash towards owner [Robert Nutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nutting \"Robert Nutting\"), with the team ranking 27th among 30 MLB team in attendance that season.[\\[112\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-114)\n\nWhen the Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009 captain [Sidney Crosby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Crosby \"Sidney Crosby\") brought the cup to PNC Park on the Sunday following the team's victory in [Detroit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit \"Detroit\").

[Harold Arlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Arlin \"Harold Arlin\"), a foreman at [Westinghouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation \"Westinghouse Electric Corporation\"), announced the game over [KDKA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDKA_(AM) \"KDKA (AM)\") from a box seat next to the first base [dugout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball) \"Dugout (baseball)\") at [Forbes Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Field \"Forbes Field\").[\\[115\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-117)[\\[116\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-Voices-118) KDKA had received its broadcasting license only nine months before, becoming the first commercially licensed radio station in the world. Pirate games would be sporadically broadcast over the radio for the next decade; regular broadcasts began in the mid-1930s, with [Rosey Rowswell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosey_Rowswell \"Rosey Rowswell\") becoming the voice of the Pirates in 1936.[\\[117\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-119) Except for a few years on [WWSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBGG_(AM) \"WBGG (AM)\") in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Pirates were on KDKA for 61 years. KDKA's 50,000-watt [clear channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear-channel_station \"Clear-channel station\") enabled Pirates fans across the eastern half of North America at night to hear the games.\n\nIn 2007, the Pirates chose to end the longest relationship between a team and a radio station in American professional sports and moved to FM [talk radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_radio \"Talk radio\") station [WPGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPGB \"WPGB\"). The Pirates cited the desire to reach more people in the 25–54 age bracket coveted by advertisers. The acquisition of the rights means that [Clear Channel Communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_Channel_Communications \"Clear Channel Communications\") holds the rights to every major sports team in Pittsburgh. The Pirates have long had a radio network that has extended across four states. Stations for the 2007 season included Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Maryland radio broadcasters.[\\[118\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-120)\n\nOn October 1, 2011, Clear Channel announced that they would not renew their deal with the Pirates, and the team shortly thereafter announced a deal to transfer back to [CBS Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Radio \"CBS Radio\") via FM [sports radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_radio \"Sports radio\") station [KDKA-FM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDKA-FM \"KDKA-FM\"),[\\[119\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-121) which became official on October 12.[\\[120\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-122)\nOn March 2, 2016, it was announced a new deal was reached for the Pirates to remain on KDKA-FM.[\\[121\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-123) As part of the deal, KDKA-AM has returned as essentially the AM flagship of the team, simulcasting all weekday afternoon games, select other broadcasts, and serving as the backup station for any games that KDKA-FM can not air due to conflicts with [Pittsburgh Panthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Panthers \"Pittsburgh Panthers\") football and men's basketball.[\\[122\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-124)\n\nGames are televised on [SportsNet Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsNet_Pittsburgh \"SportsNet Pittsburgh\"), the Pirates' cable television outlet since 1986, when it was known as KBL.

A rotating group of announcers would call games over the next 15 years until Rosey Rowswell joined the broadcast team in 1936. Rowswell did not travel with the team for road games, instead re-creating the action in Pittsburgh after it came in over the [teleprinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter \"Teleprinter\"), usually an inning or so behind. After working solo for a decade, he was joined in the booth by [Bob Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Prince \"Bob Prince\") in 1947; Prince would become the lead play-by-play man after Rowswell died in February 1955.[\\[127\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-ref1986-129) Prince's broadcasting style made him immensely popular with fans, and his almost 30-year run with the club coincided with the Pirates' rise to a championship-caliber team.[\\[128\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-130)[\\[129\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-131) Nicknamed \"The Gunner,\" Prince was known for his \"Gunnerisms\"—nicknames and quips—and created the [Green Weenie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Weenie \"Green Weenie\") in 1966. He also called the Pirates' championships in [1960](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_World_Series \"1960 World Series\") and [1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_World_Series \"1971 World Series\") as part of the national broadcast for [NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC \"NBC\").\n\nPrince and his broadcast partner [Nellie King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_King \"Nellie King\") were fired in 1975, which drew the ire of the Pirates' fanbase. [Milo Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_Hamilton \"Milo Hamilton\") and [Lanny Frattare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanny_Frattare \"Lanny Frattare\") took over as the new broadcast team in 1976. Hamilton was unhappy in Pittsburgh; he didn't get along with Frattare and felt that he was being criticized for not being Bob Prince.[\\[130\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-132) Hamilton left to join the [Chicago Cubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs \"Chicago Cubs\") after the 1979 season, and Frattare was elevated to the lead play-by-play announcer. Frattare would continue to call Pirate games through the 2008 season, becoming the longest tenured play-by-play man in team history. In turn, he was replaced by [Tim Neverett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Neverett \"Tim Neverett\"), who called Pirate games from 2009 through 2015.[\\[131\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-133)\n\nFormer analysts include [Don Hoak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hoak \"Don Hoak\"), [Nelson Briles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Briles \"Nelson Briles\"), and [Jim Rooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Rooker \"Jim Rooker\").
