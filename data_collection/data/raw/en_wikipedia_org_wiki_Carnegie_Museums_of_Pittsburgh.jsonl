With the goal of inspiring people to do good for themselves and their communities, the terms for donations required communities to support them in exchange for the building and initial investment by Carnegie.

The museum currently has seven floors of gallery and exhibition space as well as an underground education studio and conservation lab.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-7)\n\nWarhol's primary artistic technique was silkscreen pop art, which he gained notoriety for in the early 1960s. The serial images derived from the culture's consumerism and conception of beauty are reified in a form of art which represent the identity of constituents in postwar American society.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-8) Images used by Warhol, which have made him famous for his contributions to [pop art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art \"Pop art\"), include celebrities and consumables such as [Marilyn Monroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe \"Marilyn Monroe\") and [The Campbell's soup can](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/308567011944870696/).\n\nThe museum's collection includes over 4,000 Warhol art works in all [media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(arts) \"Media (arts)\")—paintings, drawings, [prints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenprint \"Screenprint\"), photographs, sculptures, and [installation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_art \"Installation art\"); the entire Andy Warhol Video Collection, 228 four-minute [Screen Tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Tests \"Screen Tests\"), and 45 other films by Warhol; and extensive archives, including Warhol's [Time Capsules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_capsule \"Time capsule\").

Designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and Associates.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-:0-10)\n\nWhen [Andrew Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie \"Andrew Carnegie\") envisioned a museum collection consisting of the \"Old Masters of tomorrow,\" the Carnegie Museum of Art arguably became the first museum of [modern art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_art \"Modern art\") in the United States. The museum was founded as the Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute in 1895. The name was changed to its current name in [\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-:1-11)1986.\n\nToday the museum continues showcasing [contemporary art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_art \"Contemporary art\") by staging the [Carnegie International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_International \"Carnegie International\") exhibition every three to five years. Numerous works from the International exhibitions have been acquired for the museums' permanent collection including [Winslow Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winslow_Homer \"Winslow Homer\")'s _The Wreck_ (1896) and [James A. McNeill Whistler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._McNeill_Whistler \"James A. McNeill Whistler\")'s _Arrangement in Black: Portrait of Señor Pablo de Sarasate_ (1884).[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-12)[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-13)\n\nThe Hall of Sculpture, constructed in white [marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble \"Marble\"), replicates the interior of the [Parthenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon \"Parthenon\").[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-14) The Hall of Architecture contains the largest collection of [plaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster \"Plaster\") casts of architectural masterpieces in America and one of the three largest in the world. Opened in 1974, the Sarah Scaife Galleries Annex was designed by [Edward Larrabee Barnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Larrabee_Barnes \"Edward Larrabee Barnes\") and Associates. The Sarah Scaife Foundation gift nearly doubled the exhibition square footage. The modernist addition was designed to not compete with the existing building. Trustee James L. Winokur says of architect Edward Larrabee Barnes, \"He kept the old building out front. He was not terribly concerned about getting credit, just concerned about doing the job right, and he did do it right.\"[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-:0-10)\n\nThe [Heinz Architectural Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Architectural_Center \"Heinz Architectural Center\"), opened as part of the museum in 1993, is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings, prints and models.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-:1-11) Most of these are from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIn 2001 the museum acquired the archive of African-American photographer [Charles \"Teenie\" Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_%22Teenie%22_Harris \"Charles \\\"Teenie\\\" Harris\"), consisting of approximately 80,000 photographic negatives spanning from the 1930s to the 1970s. Many of these images have been cataloged and digitized.\n\nThe museum's permanent collection includes European and American decorative arts from the late seventeenth century to the present, works on paper, paintings, prints (most notably Japanese prints), sculptures and installations.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-:1-11)\n\n## Carnegie Museum of Natural History\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Carnegie Museum of Natural History\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Carnegie_Museum_of_Natural_History_01.JPG/250px-Carnegie_Museum_of_Natural_History_01.JPG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carnegie_Museum_of_Natural_History_01.JPG) Carnegie Museum of Natural History\n\nMain article: [Carnegie Museum of Natural History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museum_of_Natural_History \"Carnegie Museum of Natural History\")\n\nOpened alongside the Carnegie Museum of Art in 1895, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History is currently home to over twenty million objects and artifacts. Carnegie oversaw the collecting from 1895 to 1907 and it reflected his ideas of evolutionary development.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-Gangewere-4)[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-15)\n\nMost notably, it houses a collection of 230 dinosaur fossils—including the most complete _[Tyrannosaurus rex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus_rex \"Tyrannosaurus rex\")_ known to date—as well as exhibits such as [Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillman_Hall_of_Minerals_and_Gems \"Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems\"), Alcoa Foundation Hall of American Indians, and Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt. The museum's [Powdermill Nature Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powdermill_Nature_Reserve \"Powdermill Nature Reserve\") was established in 1956 to serve as a field station for long-term studies of natural populations, and now forms the core of the museum's Center for Biodiversity and Ecosystems.

The purpose of the exhibit is for visitors to learn how people lived and worked on the boat.\n\nThe Buhl Planetarium and larger Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh merged in 1987, leading to an October 1989 groundbreaking on the newly-named Carnegie Science Center building. A large donation by the Kamin family led to the science center's renaming in 2024.[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-18)\n\n## References\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n01. ^ [Jump up to: _**a**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_ref-NRIS_1-0) [_**b**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_ref-NRIS_1-1)[\"National Register Information System\"](https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP). _[National Register of Historic Places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places \"National Register of Historic Places\")_.
