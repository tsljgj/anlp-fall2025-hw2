El equipo ha tenido mejoría notoria, especialmente en el último partido, en donde pudieron establecer bien el juego terrestre.\n\nLa defensiva empezó la temporada no en su ritmo habitual, algo normal durante los primeros partidos, pero ya en estos últimos dos juegos los intercambios de balón han sido fundamentales en las victorias del equipo.\n\nAaron Rodgers ha tenido buenos juegos con el uniforme negro y oro, cada vez luciendo más cómodo en los controles. DK Metcalf se ha convertido, como lo esperábamos, en su más fiel compañero. Les comparto el touchdown en Irlanda de esta gran dupla.\n\n> [View this post on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPSDEz9DWXI/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n>\n> [A post shared by Steelers En Español (@lossteelers)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPSDEz9DWXI/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n\nCabe señalar que los Steelers son líderes del norte de la Conferencia Americana y que será hasta el regreso del BYE Week que enfrentarán su primer encuentro divisional en contra de los Cleveland Browns, seguido de otro juego de interdivisión contra los Bengals.\n\nUn punto en el que tenemos que echar ojo es en el de las lesiones que ha sufrido el equipo. Al momento de escribir esta nota, se reportó que Jalen Ramsey (isquiotibiales) y Calvin Austin (hombro) se perderán varias semanas por lesión. Y aunque esta semana de descanso suele ser buena para recuperar esas piezas clave que vienen cargando alguna molestia, no podemos asegurar nada hasta la próxima conferencia de prensa de Coach Tomlin, previo al juego contra Cleveland.\n\nY para los que no se habían enterado, habrá evento en la Ciudad de México, Siempre Steelers regresa a la capital chilanga con una watch party increíble en el Gimnasio Olímpico Juan de la Barrera, al sur de la ciudad.

But that doesn't mean we aren't going to look at free agency, the trade market and the draft process. There are good players in every one of those areas.\"\n\nThe Steelers made some overtures to players at the start of the free agency period at the center position. Those things didn't work out.\n\nThe trade market? That's still a possibility.\n\nBut the NFL Draft comes up next week, and that is the next opportunity for the Steelers to perhaps bring in competition for Nate Herbig, currently penciled in as the starter after Mason Cole's release, at the center position.\n\nAt this point, Herbig's career at the center position consists of 47 snaps he played there for the Eagles in 2021 and two more he spent at the position there for Philadelphia in 2020.\n\nSo, of his more than 2,000 career snaps played, less than 50 have come at center.\n\nThat being said, Herbig has played the position in the NFL. That will be 49 more snaps than anyone the Steelers might select in the draft has played at center.\n\nLeft guard Isaac Seumalo also played center at Oregon State, though he has lined up at that position for just 34 snaps in his career, all coming with the Eagles.\n\nRight guard James Daniels, meanwhile, played 508 snaps at center in 2019 for the Bears, and also primarily played that position collegiately at Iowa.\n\nIn fact, in 2018, Daniels was considered one of the top center prospects in the NFL Draft.\n\nIn that draft, even though Daniels was the seventh pick of the second round, he was the fourth center selected after Detroit took Frank Ragnow 20th, the Bengals picked Billy Price 21st and Cleveland made Austin Corbett the first pick of the second round.\n\nWith Jason Kelce's retirement, Ragnow is arguably the best center in the NFL. Price, meanwhile, was a colossal flop, appearing in just 69 games before last playing for the Cardinals in 2022. And Corbett was jettisoned by Cleveland in his second season, getting traded to the Rams, where he became a guard. He's now a starter at that position for the Carolina Panthers.\n\nEven 2023 seventh-round draft pick Spencer Anderson has some center play in his background in college at Maryland.\n\nWhy bring this up?\n\nBecause many Steelers fans and pundits are locking in on the Steelers selecting a center early in this draft. And they've centered in – no pun intended – on Duke's Graham Barton, Oregon's Jackson Powers-Johnson and Zach Frazier of West Virginia.\n\nNow, certainly, those three players could certainly be in consideration for the Steelers with a first or second-round draft pick. But if they're not selected, that doesn't mean the Steelers have struck out.\n\nRemember Kelce? He was a sixth-round pick in 2011. He could very well wind up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThat brings us back to Khan's statement about valuing position flexibility.\n\nThe Steelers could covet a player who is strictly a center. But they also could look at a player who also could play guard and/or tackle.\n\nThey have multiple players on their roster who have center play in their background. They could certainly add another such player in this draft. But if they don't, it's not devastating because of their collection over the past couple of years of flexible players up front.\n\n• Two of the more versatile players available early in next week's draft are Duke center Graham Barton and Iowa defensive back Cooper DeJean.\n\nBarton started at center at Duke as a freshman but moved to left tackle the past three seasons because he was Duke's best lineman.\n\n\"I think he has legit 5-position flexibility,\" said NFL.com draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah. \"He can move around and do different things. I think he's best at center, but he can survive at tackle if you need him to. I think he's fully capable of playing guard, as well. He's the best (center in this draft) in space, change of direction, just overall athleticism. He's really, really talented there.\"\n\nAs for DeJean, he's played safety, outside cornerback, nickel cornerback and even passing down linebacker in Iowa's defense, as well as being an outstanding punt returner.\n\nDeJean intercepted seven passes in the past two seasons, returning three for touchdowns in 23 games. He also returned a punt for a touchdown.\n\n\"This guy's a special player,\" Jeremiah said on Glenn Clark radio recently. \"You can move him all over the board.\"\n\n• The new kickoff rule implemented by the NFL for the 2024 season is, in fact, causing some teams to dig deeper into return men in this draft.\n\n\"I was talking to a GM the other day, and he was going through the process of pulling returns on guys from like their freshman year,\" said Jeremiah. \"(It was) like the stuff we used to do a lot of in scouting that you really haven't had to do over the last few years as the return game has kind of diminished. But now, they're like, 'OK, we're close on these two corners. This one was a kickoff returner two, three years ago.' They're going back and watching all these returns because now that has a little bonus to it, a little added value. I think it impacts the draft, absolutely.\n\n\"I think especially this year, not knowing, I think there are teams and decision-makers that want to be ahead of the curve a little bit and view that as (something) that could be a difference-making play again.\"\n\nThat is one thing that could certainly happen. Players with return skills in their background could be valued a little higher.\n\nBut former Patriots head coach Bill Belichick thinks it also could affect who is on the field beyond the return men.\n\n\"There will be more of an emphasis on size players in the return game than speed,\" Belichick said this week on the Pat McAfee Show. \"You just need guys who can play at the point of attack, shed blocks and defend their space because of the new alignment. So, I think it will increase the size of the players that are on the field. And I do think that because everybody is spread across the field, if these returners, if they hit a little bit of space, they're gone.\"\n\nLinebackers, tight ends and maybe even some agile linemen could be used on both sides of the ball on returns.\n\nThe Steelers have a history of putting some bigger bodied defensive and offensive linemen on the field on kick returns, from Orpheus Roye to Brett Keisel to Chucky Okobi. But because of the banning of wedges on returns, they have gotten away from doing that.\n\nBut it could become en vogue again.\n\n• The Steelers have seven selections in next week's draft, picks 20, 51, 84, 98, 119, 178 and 195.\n\nIf history holds true, there's a good chance they'll spend four picks on defense and three on offense – or vice versa.\n\nLast year, they used four picks on defense and three on offense. In 2021, it was 4-4, with a pick also used on a punter. In 2020, it was a 3-3 split. In 2019, it was 5-4 in favor of the defense.\n\n_Lolley is a Contributing Writer/Editor and co-host of \"SNR Drive\" on Steelers Nation Radio.

Steelers leaned more heavily on the offensive side of the ball, taking two quarterbacks – Kenny Pickett and Chris Oladokun – with their first and last picks, respectively.\n\n• The Steelers finished up their permitted pre-draft visits and according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, those included 14 offensive linemen, seven defensive backs, six wide receivers, six defensive linemen and two linebackers.\n\nThat gives pretty solid insight into what the team's intentions happen to be heading into next week.\n\n## Related

I just like football, whether it's receiver, fullback, tight end, special teams. I just like playing ball.\"\n\nAs a receiver, though, there is always a desire to put up big numbers, to be the guy who has the ball come his way.\n\nSo far this season Skowronek has one reception for 22 yards, that being quarterback Aaron Rodgers' first touchdown pass in a Steelers uniform.\n\nHe truly doesn't care about the numbers, though.\n\nHe just wants to play football.\n\n\"As long as we're winning, I don't really care,\" said Skowronek. \"I just like playing football. I could have five catches in a game. I could have one, I could have zero. As long as we're winning, I really don't care.\n\n\"I just like to win. Whatever I'm asked to do to win a game, if one week it's catch five balls, whether it's zero balls, block the mike (linebacker). Whatever I am asked to, I'm going to go out there and give 100% effort and try to execute it to the best of my ability.\n\n\"The only stats I truly care about are special teams tackles, if I'm being honest. I just like tackling guys. That's it really.\"\n\nTackling and blocking were something former Steelers receiver Hines Ward was known for, a player Skowronek is very familiar with as his father grew up in Western Pennsylvania and he watched Steelers football.\n\nWard also caught his fair share of passes.\n\nDoes Skowronek really not mind getting the ball in his hands a lot?\n\n\"As a competitor, you obviously want the ball in your hands,\" said Skowronek. \"But I don't think I'm like any other receiver in the league. I truly don't care how many catches I have. I'll still be happy if we win.\n\n\"I want to be in the game on offense because I know what I can bring, but I feel there's a lot more ways to affect the game than just catching balls. Obviously, we have a room with DK (Metcalf) and Calvin (Austin) as our top guys. If everyone had the same role, what type of team would we have?\n\n\"So, I want to be that enforcer. I want to be the guy who can get the run game going in that room. I play special teams, too. Those are kind of the stats I care about.\n\n\"I want to just be successful as a team. I don't care who blocks a kick. I don't care who makes a tackle. I just care about winning every single Sunday.\"\n\nIt's that attitude, that approach that has made Skowronek a favorite in the Steelers locker room among his teammates.\n\nSkowronek was signed by the Steelers right before Week 1 in 2024, getting on a moving train and not having the luxury of getting to know his teammates in an offseason setting. This year, through the offseason and training camp, he was able to build a bond with them that continues to grow.\n\n\"I think Latrobe was awesome this year to spend time with the guys,\" said Skowronek. \"I didn't have that luxury last year. I came in week one, I think I got here on Tuesday and played on Sunday and didn't know the guys' names. My number one priority was learning the playbook.\n\n\"But this year I was able to spend all offseason with the guys. Obviously, in Latrobe, there's not much to do out there besides hang out with the guys. Football is a lot more than just X's and O's. It's a relationship game. You've got to be able to trust the guy next to you. You've got to be able to trust the coaches. I think that comes with not only playing together, but hanging out outside practice, outside the facility. That's what I felt like this offseason I accomplished the most. I've got a lot of close friends on the team now, just spending the nights together in Latrobe, hanging out, talking. Getting to know each other outside the game, and that just builds trust.\"\n\n**Miller waiting for his time:** When receiver/punt returner Calvin Austin III suffered a shoulder injury against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday at Dublin's Croke Park, Scotty Miller knew he had to be on alert.\n\nMiller is not just solid depth at the receiver position, but he is also Austin's backup as a punt returner.\n\nWhile Miller was ready to go, the Vikings were playing from behind and didn't punt the remainder of the game.\n\nHowever, if he is needed moving forward due to Austin's injury, Miller is ready to roll.\n\n\"I was going to be there at the end of the game,\" said Miller. \"But we didn't have any opportunities. I didn't think there really would be, just because I know they needed to score a lot of points to catch up.\n\n\"So, if (Calvin's) not playing (next game), we'll see. I'll definitely be ready to do that and just be excited for that opportunity to make some plays as well.\"\n\nMiller didn't return any punts in the regular season last year, but he isn't a stranger to it.\n\n\"I'm very comfortable,\" said Miller. \"I did it last year in the preseason. And I was backing up Calvin all year. He was healthy all year, so I didn't get any opportunities there. I did it in Atlanta a couple of times. So, throughout my career, I've always been able to do it. But I just never really had the opportunity.\n\n\"Whenever you get the opportunity to get the ball in your hands, it's something you take. So, if I get that chance, I'll work hard at it and be ready for it.\"\n\nMiller might not get the touches in the passing game that Austin and DK Metcalf do, but he would welcome any opportunity he gets whether it's because of Austin's injury or not.\n\n\"I'm excited if the opportunity comes,\" said Miller. \"I'm always ready, always looking for those opportunities. And I pride myself on being opportunistic. I know in the role I'm in, sometimes there's not many chances. But you've just got to stay ready throughout a game, throughout a season.\n\n\"And when those chances come your way, you've got to be able to take advantage.\"\n\nOne of the keys for Miller is not just to be physically prepared, but also always be mentally prepared for the opportunity.\n\nThe way he does that is through experience.\n\n\"I've been through it,\" said Miller. \"It's my seventh year in the league. I've been so many different positions on the depth chart, whether it be starting or bottom of the depth chart or inactive some weeks.\n\n\"Now it's just staying ready and staying positive mentally through it all. It's knowing that if you just come to work every single day and put your best foot forward, then you'll be ready when those opportunities come your way.\"\n\nMiller admits it's not always easy, but he doesn't expect it to be.\n\n\"Yeah, it's difficult,\" said Miller. \"Obviously, it's hard not to get frustrated at some point. Receiver is a tough position. Even if you are starting, a lot of times targets aren't going to come your way. You've got to stay level-headed and always be opportunistic.\"\n\n# [PHOTOS: Best of Week 4 vs Vikings](https://www.steelers.com/photos/photos-best-of-week-4-vs-vikings)\n\nTake a look at the best photos from the Week 4 game against the Minnesota Vikings at Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland\n\n1 / 69\n\nThe national anthem during a regular season game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings, Sunday, Sept. 28, 2025 in Dublin, Ireland.

Hard-hitting. Tough. Physical.\n\nAll of those would be spot on.\n\nBut speedster, that one might raise a few eyebrows.\n\nWell, it shouldn't.\n\nWilson showed his speed on Sunday against the Vikings when he tracked down receiver Jordan Addison, tackling him at the one-yard line after an 81-yard reception.\n\nPer Next Gen stats, Wilson hit 22 miles per hour tracking down Addison, the fastest a linebacker has run in the Next Gen Stats era (2016).\n\n\"That was huge,\" said linebacker Patrick Queen. \"He does that every single day at practice with DK (Metcalf). DK will get the ball, and he'll just try to haunt DK the whole time. He'll be talking to DK while running. He's like, you're slower than me. I'm going to catch you and stuff.\n\n\"The dude comes out there and he works every single day like that. So, I don't expect anything less.\n\n\"And that was huge for our team. As you can see, we ran time off the clock, gave us a chance. So huge shout out to him for that. You definitely don't see that in today's game. So, him being able to go out there from doing that in practice and the game was extremely huge.\"\n\nBut 22 miles an hour.\n\nThat really is unheard of.\n\n\"No, that's crazy,\" said Queen. \"Especially for a linebacker that weighs how much he weighs, which people probably don't realize. Payton is actually a heavy guy. For him to be able to run that fast, a guy who's already ahead of him and be able catch him on a short angle that's not like a true rundown angle, that's extremely impressive.\"\n\nQueen said he would take Wilson in a one-on-one race with Metcalf, even if he isn't fully confident in who the winner would be.\n\n\"I'm going to pick Payton. I think it'll be a great race,\" said Queen. \"I think DK probably will get him. I'm not going to let him hear that though, obviously. It'll be extremely fun to watch.\"\n\n**Bringing you the action:** For fans who don't want to miss any of the action, NFL+ is here, which means you can now watch the Steelers live and on the go!

{"url": "https://www.steelers.com/news/alexander-it-helps-out-tremendously", "title": "Alexander: 'It helps out tremendously'", "content": "# Alexander: 'It helps out tremendously'\n\nOct 01, 2025 at 04:15 PM\n\n[Jim Wexell](https://www.steelers.com/author/jim-wexell)\n\nCorrespondent\n\n- Copied!\n\nWhen Steelers secondary coach Gerald Alexander was asked for a timeline on the return of injured cornerback Jalen Ramsey, Alexander deferred to his boss.\n\n\"That's a head coach question,\" Alexander said. \"I've got no clue.\"\n\nNot that anyone expected Alexander to research the topic, since he's getting used to game plans with new personnel just about every week.\n\nAnd each game plan has been rich with moving pieces in his star-studded secondary.\n\nHow does he manage it?\n\n\"Well, they're all in the same room together, hearing the same information,\" said Alexander. \"So, with that being said, everybody's kind of developing at the same pace, understanding what to say, what calls are being made, what communications are being made, the emphasis that we put on them. So, it's just a matter of everybody always being prepared for when their number is called, because due to any type of circumstances guys can be inserted in there and they're expected to perform at a high level.\"\n\nMike Tomlin couldn't wait to unveil his new secondary this season. In the offseason, the Steelers added perennial Pro Bowlers Jalen Ramsey and Darius Slay, young up-and-comer Brandin Echols, and long-time NFL starters Chuck Clark and Juan Thornhill. And then they added the renowned Jabrill Peppers during the season. Of course, pillars Joey Porter Jr. and DeShon Elliott were back, and James Pierre once again rose up off the practice squad.\n\nThe additions added versatility to the group and had the defensive coaches scheming in their dreams.\n\nThen injuries hit and the schemes were instead built out of what was on hand.\n\nSo, excuse Alexander if the loss of Ramsey for a stretch doesn't have him in a panic.\n\n\"The beauty about the personnel,\" Alexander said, \"we can look at it a couple of different ways – from a matchup standpoint or just we want to be able to utilize the personnel that we have. And so those are things that we're going to talk about on a weekly basis. And just to see who we're matching up against, how can we utilize our talents that we have in the room, what specific things can we put them in positions to do to help us from a game-plan standpoint. So that's always going to be a topic of conversation with the personnel that we do have, and we have the fortunate ability to be able to have those kinds of conversations in our room.\"\n\nInjuries have cost both Porter and Elliott chunks of playing time. But Elliott returned Sunday in Ireland and was one of the stars of the game for the Steelers. He not only intercepted a pass to stop a first half Vikings drive in Steelers territory, he had a midfield strip-sack of Vikings QB Carson Wentz in the third quarter. Elliott was third on the team with 6 tackles.\n\n\"You see the impact that he had in the game just recently coming back from his setback,\" Alexander said of Elliott. \"He's always going to be a guy that we're going to always look to have a big role in.\"\n\nRamsey could miss time, but Porter could be back soon as the merry-go-round of Steelers DBs spins around.\n\n\"It helps out tremendously,\" Alexander said of Porter's return. \"Joey's a really good player. He's a significant player for us that we know can be a contributor when he's on the grass. And so getting his services back is going to be big.\n\n\"Again, it goes back to the conversation that we're going to have with what personnel do we have available, how do we best deploy our individuals out there to be able to help us achieve the game plan that we want to achieve out there on the field.\"\n\nIt's fluid, so stay tuned. The names will change to protect the game plan.\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/fj93nczuzno8fmvlrqmt.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Martin: 'He can do everything'**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Steelers have three big-time edge-rushers](https://www.steelers.com/news/martin-he-can-do-everything \"Martin: 'He can do everything'\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/nehtuvkyuhl7on8dr5kz.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**An unselfish group**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Steelers receivers have an approach where it's all about winning](https://www.steelers.com/news/an-unselfish-group \"An unselfish group\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/ae2mw2pduxgtpsetp8mo.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Next men up**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe running backs stepped up big against the Vikings with Jaylen Warren out](https://www.steelers.com/news/next-men-up-x7611 \"Next men up\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/x3rkwlk5pgphkqcfaedr.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Learning from one of the best**\\\\\n\\\\\nRookie Will Howard is progressing well, and is growing with the help of Aaron Rodgers](https://www.steelers.com/news/learning-from-one-of-the-best \"Learning from one of the best\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**The numbers do not lie**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Steelers rushed a season-high 29 times for a season-high 131 yards in Ireland](https://www.steelers.com/news/the-numbers-do-not-lie \"The numbers do not lie\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Tomlin: 'We're working and working with urgency'**\\\\\n\\\\\nCoach Mike Tomlin knows it's time for players to state their case for a spot on the 53-man roster](https://www.steelers.com/news/tomlin-we-re-working-and-working-with-urgency \"Tomlin: 'We're working and working with urgency'\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Tomlin: Trades for Williams, Smith done with eye toward stretch run**\\\\\n\\\\\nWhether two newest Steelers play Sunday against Washington remains to be seen](https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-mike-tomlin-trades-for-mike-williams-preston-smith \"Tomlin: Trades for Williams, Smith done with eye toward stretch run\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**QB artistry, O-line passion, Jaylen Warren's standard**\\\\\n\\\\\nOffensive assistants dig deep into what's making their positions tick](https://www.steelers.com/news/qb-artistry-o-line-passion-jaylen-warren-s-standard \"QB artistry, O-line passion, Jaylen Warren's standard\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Tomlin picks a starting QB but keeping it 'in-house'**\\\\\n\\\\\nVeterans Russell Wilson or Justin Fields could get the nod against Jets](https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-mike-tomlin-picks-starting-qb-but-keeping-it-in-house \"Tomlin picks a starting QB but keeping it 'in-house'\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Solving kickoff conundrum a labor of love**\\\\\n\\\\\nSpecial teams coordinator Danny Smith has Steelers on path to adapt](https://www.steelers.com/news/solving-kickoff-conundrum-a-labor-of-love \"Solving kickoff conundrum a labor of love\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Smith loves opportunity with revamped Steelers offense**\\\\\n\\\\\nNew coordinator says joining Steelers was 'home run'](https://www.steelers.com/news/arthur-smith-loves-opportunity-revamped-steelers-offense \"Smith loves opportunity with revamped Steelers offense\")\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdvertising", "source_category": "sports", "source_root_url": "https://www.steelers.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:35:10.256067", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 7400, "cleaned_content_length": 7276, "word_count": 997, "char_count": 7276, "description": "The star-studded secondary seems to be developing at the same pace", "event_date": "Oct 01, 2025", "event_time": "04:15 PM"}}

Starting in Dublin, Starks made stops across the south, west and north, visiting some well-known sites, as well as some not-so-well known, culminating the four-day journey in Belfast. The trip was documented on the Steelers Irish social media channels and stops included: Limerick, Kilkenny, the Cliffs of Moher and Derry!\n\n**A Trip North**\n\nOn Thursday, members of the organization traveled from Dublin to Northern Ireland, where The Ireland Funds and Steelers announced the establishment of the Dan and Patricia Rooney No Mind Left Behind Scholarship. Dan Rooney Sr., along with Pittsburgh businessman Tony O'Reilly, founded The Ireland Funds and the organization wanted to find a way to honor him and his wife, Patricia.\n\nThe scholarship was announced during an event in Newry, County Down, where Dan Rooney Sr.'s family ancestry is deeply rooted and is an area that he always held close to his heart. Steelers Vice President of Business Development & Strategy Dan Rooney and Ireland Funds President Caitriona Fottrell awarded scholarships to two college-bound students from Newry as well as announced donations of $10,000 to each of their schools.\n\nEarlier that day, the team hosted a free American Flag Football Clinics, presented by Aer Lingus and UPMC, in Belfast for 100 local young boys and girls. The clinic was conducted by Steelers legends Jerome Bettis, Max Starks and Ike Taylor.\n\nKarl Roser/Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n**The Team Arrives**\n\nThe Steelers departed from Pittsburgh on Thursday evening via an Aer Lingus flight from Pittsburgh International Airport and landed in Dublin on Friday. Later that day, the team held a practice at Carton House, which was covered by approximately 100 media members from around the globe.\n\nWhile practicing, the players wore special jerseys with their names translated from English to Gaelic, done by Aedin Ni Bhrianin, the Irish Language Development Officer for Munster Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). The idea for the practice jerseys originated with Steelers equipment manager Adam Regan, who presented it to team President Art Rooney II and Vice President of Business Development & Strategy Dan Rooney.\n\n**Fitzsimons Pub: Home Away From Home**\n\nOne of Dublin's most historic pubs turned into homebase for Steelers Nation over the course of game weekend. Fitzsimons Pub, located in Temple Bar, literally became part of Steelers Country – with branding on both the inside and outside of the pub. Live entertainment included Irish music, as well as 8+ hours a day of live Steelers audio programming, including SNR Drive & The WDVE Morning Show, emanating from the top floor of the pub each day. Fans were also treated to alumni appearances, including one by Maurkice Pouncey, who poured his own pint from behind the bar!\n\nOver a three day period, over 3,000 fans visited Fitzsimmons.\n\n\"We normally have strong weekends when it comes to the All-Ireland Finals, Irish Rugby, Irish Football, New Years Eve & even St. Patrick's weekend, which is normally our strongest weekend every year,\" said Romy Carroll, the pub's Sales & Marketing Manager. \"But we've never seen anything like the crowds of supporters and fans that the Steelers bought in to Fitzsimons over the weekend.\"\n\n**Fan Tailgate in Merrion Square Park**\n\nFrom Friday through Sunday, the Fáilte Steelers Tailgate, presented by Aer Lingus, provided a place for Steelers fans to gather in the heart of Dublin's City Centre in picturesque Merrion Square Park.\n\nOver the course of the three days, over 20,000 Steelers fans attended the free event and enjoyed food and beverage, live music and entertainment, lawn games, video programming and much more. The weekend kicked off with a bang as those in attendance were treated to a Q&A session with Legends Ben Roethlisberger, Maurkice Pouncey and Ike Taylor. Saturday included performances from lrish dancers, a live band and more alumni appearances from Max Starks and James Farrior. Sunday provided a place for fans to watch the game for free on two large video screens.\n\nThe Tailgate also featured American football youth flag clinics, presented by Aer Lingus & UPMC. Over the course of three days, over 200 young people got coaching tips from Steelers Legends.\n\n**A Visit To The Ambassador's Residence**\n\nThe NFL hosted a flag football event at the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland's residence in Phoenix Park on Saturday, an opportunity for approximately 40 youth from area schools to take part in a five-on-five NFL Flag Football Tournament. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Steelers President Art Rooney II and Steelers Vice President of Business Development & Strategy Dan Rooney were in attendance for the fun-filled afternoon, which included gift exchanges with U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Edward Walsh. Ben Roethlisberger, Maurkice Pouncey and Ike Taylor were all on hand to provide instruction and encouragement for the youth.\n\n**Town Hall Forum & Pittsburgh Reception**\n\nLater in the day on Saturday, Art Rooney II and Jerome Bettis spoke as part of a panel at NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's Town Hall. The Town Hall, an event the commissioner normally hosts at NFL International events, hit on a wide range of topics, from the growing global market to fan support in cities around the globe, and everything in between.\n\nMeanwhile, Steelers Vice President of Business Development and Strategy Dan Rooney also spoke at The Pittsburgh Reception, an event celebrating the economic and cultural partnership between Ireland and the Pittsburgh region.\n\n**Steelers Pro Shop Ireland**\n\nThe Steelers opened an official retail location in Dublin earlier in the month of September and while business was brisk in the first few weeks, game week saw the official Steelers Pro Shop in Ireland attract shoppers by the thousands. Steelers Nation from around the world stopped to check out the Ireland collection, as did Steelers President Art Rooney II and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. In addition, Jerome Bettis surprised shoppers by stopping in on the Friday of game week to meet fans and sign autographs.\n\n**Game Day**\n\nOn Sunday, one of Europe's largest and most historic stadiums turned into a sea of Black & Gold. Steelers fans from all over the world showed out at Croke Park to support the team, with Terrible Towels on full display throughout the day. The Terrible Towel Twirl was led by Ben Roethlisberger, Jerome Bettis and renowned Irish athletes Stephanie Roche and Paudie Clifford. The pregame sequence also featured the unfurling of a giant Terrible Towel in the stands. The game was full of memorable plays and finished off with the Steelers securing a memorable win.\n\nBrendan Moran/Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nBen McShane/Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nKarl Roser/Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nback to top\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/syc5g76wpers8hzkfrfz.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Irish eyes were smiling**\\\\\n\\\\\nMike Prisuta of the Steelers Audio Network looks back at a trip to remember](https://www.steelers.com/news/irish-eyes-were-smiling-x9038 \"Irish eyes were smiling\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/ftabibfkugcgdjveuqn0.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Ireland Blog: Home sweet home...kind of**\\\\\n\\\\\nFollow along for all of the news, notes and activities as a part of the Steelers visit to Dublin, Ireland to take on the Minnesota Vikings this week](https://www.steelers.com/news/ireland-blog-terrible-towel-tour-is-underway-in-dunlin \"Ireland Blog: Home sweet home...kind of\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/movwcxnr4bdgkdvmsj82.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**A special game for the Rooney family**\\\\\n\\\\\nArt Rooney II and Dan Rooney understand the significance of Sunday's game in Dublin](https://www.steelers.com/news/a-special-game-for-the-rooney-family \"A special game for the Rooney family\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/gomls8mxg4c8pqp11itn.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Making a name for themselves with unique jerseys**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers players wore jerseys at practice with Gaelic translations of their names at practice on Friday](https://www.steelers.com/news/making-a-name-for-themselves-with-unique-jerseys \"Making a name for themselves with unique jerseys\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Honoring the memory of Dan and Patricia Rooney**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Ireland Funds introduced the No Mind Left Behind: Dan & Patricia Rooney Scholarship during an event in Newry, Northern Ireland on Thursday](https://www.steelers.com/news/honoring-the-memory-of-dan-and-patricia-rooney \"Honoring the memory of Dan and Patricia Rooney\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**'The Standard: Homecoming' highlights the trip to Ireland**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe episode will first air on Friday, Sept. 26 at 7 p.m.](https://www.steelers.com/news/the-standard-homecoming-highlights-the-trip-to-ireland \"'The Standard: Homecoming' highlights the trip to Ireland\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**'A Steelers Story' features 'The Ambassador'**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe latest episode of 'A Steelers Story' features Dan Rooney Sr. and his strong connection to Ireland](https://www.steelers.com/news/a-steelers-story-features-the-ambassador \"'A Steelers Story' features 'The Ambassador' \")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**'The Terrible Towel Tour' is set to embark on Ireland**\\\\\n\\\\\nFormer Steelers offensive lineman Max Starks will take part in 'The Terrible Towel Tour'](https://www.steelers.com/news/the-terrible-towel-tour-is-set-to-embark-on-ireland \"'The Terrible Towel Tour' is set to embark on Ireland\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Broadcast crew announced for Steelers-Vikings game**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe NFL Network broadcast crew for the 2025 NFL Dublin game has been announced](https://www.steelers.com/news/broadcast-crew-announced-for-steelers-vikings-game \"Broadcast crew announced for Steelers-Vikings game\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**The Dublin Game will be filled with plenty of Black & Gold flavor**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Emerald Isle will turn Black & Gold as fans gear-up for the historic Dublin Game](https://www.steelers.com/news/the-dublin-game-will-be-filled-with-plenty-of-black-gold-flavor \"The Dublin Game will be filled with plenty of Black & Gold flavor\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**On this date: Steelers took to the field in Ireland**\\\\\n\\\\\nJuly 27th is a special day for sporting fans across the island of Ireland.

Watt. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers hit tight end Darnell Washington for 8 yards to start the march.\n\nAfter that, Gainwell carried for gains of 7, 6, 10 and 4 yards on the way to the end zone.\n\n\"You know, that drive, we went down and scored after T.J.'s interception, (Gainwell) was doing a really good job of controlling the game,\" Faulkner said. \"You saw some patience come out on him. Whether it was gap-scheme or zone-scheme he was being patient, letting the blocks develop for him and then bursting through the hole.\n\n\"That was a really good series to see where he kind of took the game over. But Kenny's a vet, professional, and so I expect him to be able to do those things, to be honest.\"\n\nA bonus against Minnesota was the opportunity to get rookie running back Kaleb Johnson involved.\n\nJohnson hadn't been used in the Steelers 21-14 win on Sept. 21 at New England after failing to field a kickoff in the Steelers' 31-17 loss to the Seahawks on Sept. 14.\n\nThe gaffe against Seattle was part of what has been a slow start for Johnson.\n\nBut the Steelers haven't lost faith in their third-round draft pick from Iowa.\n\nJohnson carried six times for 22 yards against the Vikings, the first time he's rushed more than once in a game this season.\n\n\"He has the luxury of having two really good veterans that have played a lot in front of him who are selfless and willing to help him in any way they can,\" Faulkner said, referencing Warren and Gainwell. \"Obviously, (Johnson) is a great talent. There's some growth there, he knows that. We all know that and we're just going to keep working toward it because we know we're going to need him to win here down the stretch.\n\n\"That was a big boost for him, that last drive that he was in. He was able to get a couple good runs in there and I could feel a little bit of some of the pressure that he had been feeling lift off his shoulders.\n\n\"I expect him to keep getting better and better.\"\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/fj93nczuzno8fmvlrqmt.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Martin: 'He

{"url": "https://www.steelers.com/news/smith-we-looked-smooth-sunday", "title": "Smith: 'We looked smooth Sunday' ", "content": "# Smith: 'We looked smooth Sunday'\n\nSep 30, 2025 at 04:15 PM\n\n[Jim Wexell](https://www.steelers.com/author/jim-wexell)\n\nCorrespondent\n\n- Copied!\n\nLife as a special teams coach can take funny bounces.\n\nAlmost as if it's an onsides kick.\n\nFortunately for Steelers special teams coordinator Danny Smith, there weren't any funny bounces Sunday during the onsides kick Roman Wilson fielded with 2:08 remaining in a three-point game against the Vikings.\n\nIn fact, it was pretty smooth.\n\n\"We looked smooth Sunday,\" Smith said in emphasizing the day.\n\nBut they had to do it again. The Steelers called timeout just before the start of the first onsides kick. That meant the Steelers needed another smooth recovery on the second one.\n\n\"Here's the deal,\" Smith said in explaining the timeout. \"This (Vikings kicker) had no onside kicks in his career. None. Played three games in the National Football League, in his fourth. This kid was a kicker at Alabama. How many times do they onside kick? OK? I watch all the tape. Everybody, everything. I'll tell you every number of onside kicks everybody has that we play, what his percentages are, where he's going with the ball, what his movement is, everything. We had nothing on this kid. So, it was very smart that Mike Tomlin suggested we take a timeout. It was a great move on the head coach's part. We took a timeout, took a look. We got the exact same kick – because the kid is inexperienced – and we were able to recover. So, there is so much science and so much thinking that goes into these things that people have no clue about. That's our job.\"\n\nUntil the ball takes a crazy bounce. And THAT, Smith emphasized, is what onsides kicks are all about.\n\n\"It's amazing, really,\" Smith said. \"We play the game 59 minutes and 30 seconds, or whatever it is. There's a minute left in the game, 30 seconds left in the game, and really we're working on the bounce of the ball. There are some people that don't get that recovery, and it's simply the bounce of the ball. I mean, it really is the bounce of the ball, and it's sad to come to that. But really, it comes down to the bounce of the ball, because if we didn't get that, y'all be ripping me about it. And that just comes with the territory. I get it. But it's really the bounce of the ball. We made the play.\"\n\nWilson recovered both times. So, if it were a typical Friday practice day, he could've left the field.\n\n\"We work it every Friday,\" Smith said of the specialty play. \"Everybody has to get two onside kicks clean, or they can't leave the field. We work it every Friday since I've been here.\"\n\nSo it was just another day at the office for Roman Wilson and the Steelers.\n\nThere were a couple of other special teams oddities in the 24-21 win in Dublin that Smith addressed when he got back home to the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex:\n\n\\\\* What happened when the Vikings blocked Chris Boswell's 30-yard field goal attempt?\n\n\"It was just a lack of technique by a player,\" Smith said. \"It was a good jump by an opposing player. He had great speed coming off the edge and he did a good job, more power to him. But it was a lack of technique on our part.\"\n\n\\\\* Why did Corliss Waitman punt into the end zone for a 20-yard net with 1:08 remaining?\n\n\"I'm not worried about his net punting at that time. I'm worried about winning a game. They've got a returner back there? We're gonna win the game. They got one timeout starting at the 20? Win the game.\"\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/a8p85baegl0hdzjtu93f.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**The arrow is pointing up**\\\\\n\\\\\nDefensive coordinator Teryl Austin says that things are starting to trend in the right direction](https://www.steelers.com/news/the-arrow-is-pointing-up \"The arrow is pointing up\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/lwidw4lcavpbfqegfeed.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Coordinators keep working**\\\\\n\\\\\nThere's still a ways to go but signs they can get there](https://www.steelers.com/news/coordinators-keep-working \"Coordinators keep working\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/v6hjvhwrs2ie2jav4gnk.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Weighty moments**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers working toward better execution on impactful snaps on both sides of the ball](https://www.steelers.com/news/weighty-moments \"Weighty moments\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/q1hpey9d1ilhtuh44yuw.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Room for improvement**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers beat Jets despite getting less than they seek from running game, run defense](https://www.steelers.com/news/room-for-improvement \"Room for improvement\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**'You've got to see around corners'**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers armed with optimism, perspective as season commences](https://www.steelers.com/news/you-ve-got-to-see-around-corners \"'You've got to see around corners'\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**One step at a time**\\\\\n\\\\\nGround game, run defense following similar, steady trajectories](https://www.steelers.com/news/one-step-at-a-time \"One step at a time\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Getting a feel for them**\\\\\n\\\\\nOffensive coordinator Arthur Smith and defensive coordinator Teryl Austin liked what they saw in the preseason opener, but there is still work to be done](https://www.steelers.com/news/getting-a-feel-for-them \"Getting a feel for them\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Smith wants to maximize everyone's talents**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers OC accepts challenges of turning over the offense](https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-arthur-smith-wants-to-maximize-everyone-talents \"Smith wants to maximize everyone's talents\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Ease his pain**\\\\\n\\\\\nRodgers' arrival means Austin no longer has to coordinate against him](https://www.steelers.com/news/ease-his-pain \"Ease his pain\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**From stacks, motions and bunches to Henry and Lamar**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers' defense aware of the challenges that await facing the Ravens](https://www.steelers.com/news/from-stacks-motions-and-bunches-to-henry-and-lamar \"From stacks, motions and bunches to Henry and Lamar\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Appropriate response**\\\\\n\\\\\nAustin appreciates emotion, determination to get 'get it right' on defense](https://www.steelers.com/news/appropriate-response \"Appropriate response\")\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdvertising", "source_category": "sports", "source_root_url": "https://www.steelers.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:35:10.262627", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 6770, "cleaned_content_length": 6646, "word_count": 931, "char_count": 6646, "description": "A successful onsides kick recovery heped seal the win against the Vikings", "event_date": "Sep 30, 2025", "event_time": "04:15 PM"}}

{"url": "https://www.steelers.com/news/the-arrow-is-pointing-up", "title": "The arrow is pointing up", "content": "# The arrow is pointing up\n\nOct 01, 2025 at 01:00 PM\n\n[Mike Prisuta](https://www.steelers.com/author/mike-prisuta)\n\nSteelers.com\n\n[Opens Twitter profile page in new window - Opens new window](https://twitter.com/DVEMike)\n\n- Copied!\n\nArrow pointing up: After some struggles at the outset of the season, the Steelers' defense has begun to find its collective stride.\n\n\"We're getting there,\" defensive coordinator Teryl Austin assessed today.\n\nJust as Austin suspected the defense would all along.\n\n\"I've said it, I know we hadn't played well early but I know we have enough good players and that things will start trending in the right direction,\" Austin continued. \"I think we took a step forward (last Sunday), absolutely. But we also know we left a lot out there and there's a lot of room to improve.\n\n\"I really love the way our guys competed and performed last week and we know we can be better.\"\n\nThe Steelers amassed six sacks, 14 quarterback hits, two interceptions and eight passes defensed in last Sunday's 24-21 win over the Vikings in Dublin.\n\nMoving forward, \"better\" would include eliminating occasional breakdowns in coverage, specifically the one that resulted in an 81-yard, catch-and-run chunk play to the Steelers' 1-yard line from Vikings quarterback Carson Wentz to uncovered wide receiver Jordan Addison that helped Minnesota eventually close to within three points with 2:08 left in regulation.\n\n\"I'm gonna take that one,\" Austin insisted. \"We were struggling with who was in the game and I probably made a call that probably wasn't simple enough for everybody, so that's on me. If that ever happens again, if we have some attrition the way we did, the way it happened, I gotta give our guys something that's way more simple and that they can line up and play. It may not be the best defense but it'll be something where we won't have a chance to blow it.\n\n\"Our guys played great and again, that last one is on me and I'll make sure that doesn't happen again.\"\n\nThe Steelers had lost cornerbacks Jalen Ramsey and Brandin Echols to injury by that juncture.\n\nEchols returned for the final defensive series, which began at the Minnesota 20 with 1:02 left in the fourth quarter and ended when the Vikings threw an incomplete pass on fourth-and-17 from the Minnesota 32 with 14 seconds to play.\n\nThe Wentz-to-Addison dagger may have been much more damaging had inside linebacker Payton Wilson not sprinted down the field and tackled Addison in bounds at the Steelers' 1.\n\nThe Vikings ended up requiring an additional four plays to score in the wake of Wilson's relentless hustle.\n\n\"It was unbelievable,\" Austin said. \"It's probably the difference in the game. You make them run three plays. You make them burn time off the clock. And then if they do, and they did, get an opportunity to go back down, now you're talking about a minute less time to try to get into field goal range.\n\n\"So it was a huge play. It's why we talk to our guys all the time, that's why we run to the ball. We talk about it in practice all the time, to finish and do those things and he did it and it was a great individual effort. His individual effort helped our team win the game.\"\n\nOutside linebacker Nick Herbig also made his individual presence felt again in his second consecutive start in place of Alex Highsmith (ankle).\n\nHerbig's pressure induced an intentional grounding penalty against Wentz on first-and-10 from the Minnesota 39 with 43 seconds left.\n\nHerbig finished with 1.5 sacks, a tackle for a loss and three quarterback hits against Minnesota after producing a sack, a tackle for a loss and four quarterback hits in the Steelers' 21-14 win on Sept. 21 at New England.\n\nHis emergence has the Steelers re-evaluating the division of labor at outside linebacker once Highsmith returns from injury.\n\n\"We are not gonna limit Nick Herbig,\" Austin announced. \"He is showing up every week. He is disruptive. He's a really good player for us and we're gonna continue to find ways to get him on the field.\"\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/blegye2xrp2iswguqo8k.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Smith: 'We looked smooth Sunday'**\\\\\n\\\\\nA successful onsides kick recovery heped seal the win against the Vikings](https://www.steelers.com/news/smith-we-looked-smooth-sunday \"Smith: 'We looked smooth Sunday' \")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/lwidw4lcavpbfqegfeed.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Coordinators keep working**\\\\\n\\\\\nThere's still a ways to go but signs they can get there](https://www.steelers.com/news/coordinators-keep-working \"Coordinators keep working\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/v6hjvhwrs2ie2jav4gnk.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Weighty moments**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers working toward better execution on impactful snaps on both sides of the ball](https://www.steelers.com/news/weighty-moments \"Weighty moments\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/q1hpey9d1ilhtuh44yuw.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Room for improvement**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers beat Jets despite getting less than they seek from running game, run defense](https://www.steelers.com/news/room-for-improvement \"Room for improvement\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**'You've got to see around corners'**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers armed with optimism, perspective as season commences](https://www.steelers.com/news/you-ve-got-to-see-around-corners \"'You've got to see around corners'\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**One step at a time**\\\\\n\\\\\nGround game, run defense following similar, steady trajectories](https://www.steelers.com/news/one-step-at-a-time \"One step at a time\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Getting a feel for them**\\\\\n\\\\\nOffensive coordinator Arthur Smith and defensive coordinator Teryl Austin liked what they saw in the preseason opener, but there is still work to be done](https://www.steelers.com/news/getting-a-feel-for-them \"Getting a feel for them\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Smith wants to maximize everyone's talents**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers OC accepts challenges of turning over the offense](https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-arthur-smith-wants-to-maximize-everyone-talents \"Smith wants to maximize everyone's talents\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Ease his pain**\\\\\n\\\\\nRodgers' arrival means Austin no longer has to coordinate against him](https://www.steelers.com/news/ease-his-pain \"Ease his pain\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**From stacks, motions and bunches to Henry and Lamar**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers' defense aware of the challenges that await facing the Ravens](https://www.steelers.com/news/from-stacks-motions-and-bunches-to-henry-and-lamar \"From stacks, motions and bunches to Henry and Lamar\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Appropriate response**\\\\\n\\\\\nAustin appreciates emotion, determination to get 'get it right' on defense](https://www.steelers.com/news/appropriate-response \"Appropriate response\")\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdvertising", "source_category": "sports", "source_root_url": "https://www.steelers.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:35:10.273617", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 7336, "cleaned_content_length": 7212, "word_count": 987, "char_count": 7212, "description": "Defensive coordinator Teryl Austin says that things are starting to trend in the right direction", "event_date": "Oct 01, 2025", "event_time": "01:00 PM"}}

And Steelers fans know there is no place like home, as Acrisure Stadium is always electric on game day.\n\nSteelers Style, which is presented by Amazon, Neighborhood Ford Store, PNC, UPMC and UPMC Health Plan, is co-chaired by Art and Greta Rooney and Mike and Kiya Tomlin.\n\nSteelers Style, which is the team's largest annual fundraiser, benefits UPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program, Cancer Bridges and the Chuck Noll Foundation.\n\n\"To do it for the charities, that is special and really cool,\" said Elliott. \"As players, we are blessed to play this game. But to be able to give back to the community as well, it is really cool.\"\n\nThere will also be an online auction, presented by Acrisure, that will benefit the three charities.\n\nItems in the auction include signed items and memorabilia from current players, an exclusive private tour of the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum, a chance to design the next Terrible Towel, autographed Limited Edition Terrible Towels, tickets to the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre's performance of the Nutcracker and a private backstage tour, and more. The auction will run from noon on Oct. 8 though noon on Oct. 17.\n\n**About the charities:**\n\nUPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program: The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Sports Medicine Concussion Program, established in 2000, is the first of its kind and largest ongoing clinical service and research program that focuses on diagnosis, evaluation and management of sports-related concussion in athletes of all levels. Led by Michael Collins, PhD, the program's internationally known team of clinicians and researchers are world leaders in studying the neurocognitive effects of sports-related concussion and pioneering the development of better methods of post-concussion evaluation to determine when it is safe for an athlete to return to sports. The team provides oversight and consultation to assist sports teams' medical staff in making objective return-to-play decisions after the occurrence of sports-related concussion.\n\nCancer Bridges: Cancer Bridges supports those impacted by cancer through a variety of free programs and services and has been a proud beneficiary of Steelers Style since 1992. The organization provides a warm and welcoming environment for everyone impacted by cancer, including those with a diagnosis, survivors, and those who have a loved one with cancer or have experienced the loss of a loved one due to cancer. Cancer Bridges serves individuals of all ages and offers nearly 200 programs monthly, providing emotional, social, and informational tools for adults, youth, and families through counseling sessions, support groups, health and wellness programs, social activities, and more.\n\nChuck Noll Foundation: The Steelers launched the Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research in 2016 to support continued research and education regarding brain injuries and treatment of sports-related concussions. The Foundation funds research that it believes is the most promising in the area of sports-related concussions and related conditions. To help best evaluate which research programs to fund, some of the most renowned neurosurgeons in the country serve on a national medical advisory panel.\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/znmehjx3nqgmb3ay2fw5.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Community Corner: Taking time to listen**\\\\\n\\\\\nFollow along for all of the latest Steelers in the Community happenings](https://www.steelers.com/news/community-corner-showing-appreciation \"Community Corner: Taking time to listen\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/qu6j2vcxeipye6nfhitp.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Honoring Pittsburgh's finest while helping others**\\\\\n\\\\\nArea leaders were honored at the annual Art Rooney Awards Dinner, which benefits the Catholic Youth Association](https://www.steelers.com/news/honoring-pittsburgh-s-finest-while-helping-others \"Honoring Pittsburgh's finest while helping others\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/j3hj54ol6dkloepexozv.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Freiermuth Fund comes from the heart**\\\\\n\\\\\nPat Freiermuth comes from a family of educators, so giving back to the education field is only natural for him](https://www.steelers.com/news/freiermuth-fund-comes-from-the-heart \"Freiermuth Fund comes from the heart\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/lb129sm4u9gsyaqpbm8c.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Scholarship winners grateful for the opportunity**\\\\\n\\\\\nThree area students were presented with the Art Rooney Scholarship](https://www.steelers.com/news/scholarship-winners-grateful-for-the-opportunity \"Scholarship winners grateful for the opportunity\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Rookies get a full taste of the NFL**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Steelers Rookie Development Program helps young players adjust to life in the NFL](https://www.steelers.com/news/rookies-get-a-full-taste-of-the-nfl \"Rookies get a full taste of the NFL\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**A celebration like no other**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Mel Blount Youth Home All-Star Celebrity Roast honored the 50th Anniversary of Super Bowl IX](https://www.steelers.com/news/a-celebration-like-no-other \"A celebration like no other\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**A great day for the Irish**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Ireland Funds Pittsburgh dinner was held at Acrisure Stadium on St. Patrick's Day](https://www.steelers.com/news/a-great-day-for-the-irish \"A great day for the Irish\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**The Ireland Funds Pittsburgh includes unique online auction**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe awardees for the 2025 The Ireland Funds Pittsburgh, as well as the online auction, have been announced](https://www.steelers.com/news/ireland-funds-pittsburgh-event-includes-unique-online-auction \"The Ireland Funds Pittsburgh includes unique online auction\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Steelers give back through Social Justice Fund**\\\\\n\\\\\nSteelers announce more than half a million dollars in donations to this year's Social Justice Fund Initiative](https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-give-back-through-social-justice-fund-x8119 \"Steelers give back through Social Justice Fund\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Holiday cheer is in the air**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Steelers are spreading cheer and joy during the holiday season](https://www.steelers.com/news/holiday-cheer-is-in-the-air \"Holiday cheer is in the air\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Community Corner: Holiday magic**\\\\\n\\\\\nFollow along for all of the latest Steelers in the Community happenings](https://www.steelers.com/news/community-corner-all-the-latest-community-happenings \"Community Corner: Holiday magic\")\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdvertising", "source_category": "sports", "source_root_url": "https://www.steelers.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:35:10.273617", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 8213, "cleaned_content_length": 8089, "word_count": 1013, "char_count": 8089, "description": "DK Metcalf and DeShon Elliott will serve as co-captains for Steelers Style", "event_date": "Oct 02, 2025", "event_time": "02:32 PM"}}

Watt and Alex Highsmith. Herbig had 3 sacks as a rookie and then 5.5 sacks last season. But in only two-plus games in relief of the injured Highsmith, Herbig has stepped in like Lou Gehrig and been a force.\n\nTo wit:\n\nT.J. Watt, in 238 snaps, has 3 sacks. 5 tackles-for-loss, 6 QB hits, an interception, forced fumble, and fumble recovery.\n\nClassic All-Pro stuff from T.J.\n\nHerbig, in 178 snaps, has 2.5 sacks, 4 tackles-for-loss, 8 QB hits, an interception and forced fumble.\n\nClassic Steelers dual-edge numbers.\n\nAnd the return of Highsmith will make it a three-edge world.\n\n\"Very, very excited,\" Martin said. \"Just want to get all those dudes together. That's why we got them all, so we can have all four together. It's gonna be good stuff for us.\"\n\nOh, and rookie Jack Sawyer makes a fourth viable edge-rusher. In 14 snaps, Sawyer has a sack, 2 tackles-for-loss, and ranks second among the team's edge-rushers with 14 tackles, only 5 behind Watt in 223 fewer snaps.\n\nIt's almost as if Sawyer's soaking up the atmosphere around here.\n\n\"We enjoy having the four, the Full Metal Jacket,\" Martin said. \"Getting them all going will be nice, for real.\"\n\nHerbig missed the opener, but in the 10 snaps that Martin had his \"Full Metal Jacket\" available, he used the \"three starters\" on the field altogether on third-down passing situations. Nothing landed, but the blueprint was drawn.\n\nBut then Highsmith went down in the second quarter of Week Two with an ankle injury. In stepped Herbig, who intercepted a fourth-and-1 pass (off a Cam Heyward deflection) that game. The next week, during a 14-14 tie game at New England, Herbig's fourth-quarter strip-sack, on a Patriots first-down play at the Pittsburgh 33, was recovered by Watt to set the Steelers up for their game-winning drive. Against the Vikings in Dublin, Herbig's third-and-12 sack in the second quarter set up Aaron Rodgers' 80-yard TD pass to DK Metcalf that sent the Steelers off and running. To seal the win, Herbig pressured QB Carson Wentz into an intentional grounding penalty that lost 16 yards (and 10 seconds). The Vikings couldn't recover from second-and-26 and the Steelers improved to 3-1.\n\n\"Nick's a good football player. That's just what he is. He can do everything,\" Martin said. \"People like to think he's just a pass guy, but if you watch the tape from this past week, he was (defending) run, pass, anything we needed him to be – special teams, you know what I mean? He just does it all. He's just gonna continue to get better every week.\"\n\nAt 240 pounds, Herbig's game is based more off quickness than size. But according to Martin – who took over the OLB coaching position the same year Herbig was drafted – Herbig's run defense has improved significantly. Martin was asked how that development occurred.\n\n\"Just the constant stuff we do in individual every day,\" Martin said. \"We're on the sleds, putting our hands on people, using our hands, releasing off people, and making plays. I just think he continually does that each week and he puts it on tape.\"\n\nWatt and Herbig, both from the University of Wisconsin, have 5.5 of the Steelers' 14 sacks. Extrapolated out over 17 games, those 14 sacks would become 59.5, enough to break the team record of 56 set in both the 2017 and 2020 seasons that were 16 games in length.\n\nThe \"Blitzburgh\" defense of 1994 had 55 sacks.\n\n\"We just like to get after the passer,\" Martin said. \"Blitzes sometimes get us our one-on-ones and the things that we want and help us get to the passer easier.\n\n\"It's all exciting. That's Blitzburgh. That's what I've known since I've been here. And we just want to keep going.\"\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_png/steelers/nehtuvkyuhl7on8dr5kz.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**An unselfish group**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Steelers receivers have an approach where it's all about winning](https://www.steelers.com/news/an-unselfish-group \"An unselfish group\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_png/steelers/ae2mw2pduxgtpsetp8mo.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Next men up**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe running backs stepped up big against the Vikings with Jaylen Warren out](https://www.steelers.com/news/next-men-up-x7611 \"Next men up\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_png/steelers/x3rkwlk5pgphkqcfaedr.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Learning from one of the best**\\\\\n\\\\\nRookie Will Howard is progressing well, and is growing with the help of Aaron Rodgers](https://www.steelers.com/news/learning-from-one-of-the-best \"Learning from one of the best\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/x3iksesc4aro695ofrlb.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Alexander: 'It helps out tremendously'**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe star-studded secondary seems to be developing at the same pace](https://www.steelers.com/news/alexander-it-helps-out-tremendously \"Alexander: 'It helps out tremendously'\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/iphwmcfvntl2dtctiyup.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**The numbers do not lie**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Steelers rushed a season-high 29 times for a season-high 131 yards in Ireland](https://www.steelers.com/news/the-numbers-do-not-lie \"The numbers do not lie\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_png/steelers/q2lvnaeebddjc15b3fxx.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Tomlin: 'We're working and working with urgency'**\\\\\n\\\\\nCoach Mike Tomlin knows it's time for players to state their case for a spot on the 53-man roster](https://www.steelers.com/news/tomlin-we-re-working-and-working-with-urgency \"Tomlin: 'We're working and working with urgency'\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/dn5mgo7m4oktqq6k3ljv.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Tomlin: Trades for Williams, Smith done with eye toward stretch run**\\\\\n\\\\\nWhether two newest Steelers play Sunday against Washington remains to be seen](https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-mike-tomlin-trades-for-mike-williams-preston-smith \"Tomlin: Trades for Williams, Smith done with eye toward stretch run\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/emobs2dv4vpyx7ma4rgm.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**QB artistry, O-line passion, Jaylen Warren's standard**\\\\\n\\\\\nOffensive assistants dig deep into what's making their positions tick](https://www.steelers.com/news/qb-artistry-o-line-passion-jaylen-warren-s-standard \"QB artistry, O-line passion, Jaylen Warren's standard\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/k77jwyph11ugb7dzaoyx.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Tomlin picks a starting QB but keeping it 'in-house'**\\\\\n\\\\\nVeterans Russell Wilson or Justin Fields could get the nod against Jets](https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-mike-tomlin-picks-starting-qb-but-keeping-it-in-house \"Tomlin picks a starting QB but keeping it 'in-house'\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/sokqtimw3ewwrtpsnljf.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Solving kickoff conundrum a labor of love**\\\\\n\\\\\nSpecial teams coordinator Danny Smith has Steelers on path to adapt](https://www.steelers.com/news/solving-kickoff-conundrum-a-labor-of-love \"Solving kickoff conundrum a labor of love\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/ipvbpgijduaihoz0qpn9.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Smith loves opportunity with revamped Steelers offense**\\\\\n\\\\\nNew coordinator says joining Steelers was 'home run'](https://www.steelers.com/news/arthur-smith-loves-opportunity-revamped-steelers-offense \"Smith loves opportunity with revamped Steelers offense\")\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdvertising", "source_category": "sports", "source_root_url": "https://www.steelers.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:35:10.278162", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 8524, "cleaned_content_length": 8407, "word_count": 1076, "char_count": 8407, "description": "The Steelers have three big-time edge-rushers", "event_date": "Oct 02, 2025", "event_time": "04:40 PM"}}

And the turnover from 2024 playoff lineup to 2025 opener was 38 percent, still a sizable turnover.\n\nFor a coach whose goal of the preseason was to get his players to \"the starting line\" in good health, the building -- the true team building -- didn't begin until the regular season did.\n\nAnd the Steelers have obviously improved from Week One to Week Four, when the sizable import of new players began to settle in.\n\nThe Steelers entered their bye week at 3-1 with road wins against two AFC opponents. The fact they rank 29th in offense and 28th in defense offers promise that so much improvement is yet to occur.\n\nHow did they do it?\n\nWell, their \"turnover culture\" is alive and well. The Steelers are second in the NFL with a +7 margin in turnovers, much of that due to a third-place standing in total sacks with 14.\n\nThey are also seventh in red zone TD percentage, so they not only get extra chances with turnovers, they take advantage with touchdowns.\n\nIndividually, only Aaron Rodgers has a top-10 spot in key rankings. The Steelers' new QB is fourth with 8 TD passes and ninth with a 102.6 passer rating.\n\nBut statistics don't tell the story of \"winning while building\" at 3-1. The highlights have kept Steelers Nation on the edge of its collective seat throughout the first quarter of the season. Here's a game-by-game look at the best of the first four games:\n\n**Steelers 34, Jets 32**\n\n\\- First TD of the season a play-action, roll right pass from Rodgers to a wide open Ben Skowronek.\n\n\\- Chris Boswell kicked field goals of 56 and a team-record 60 yards, the latter turning out to be the game-winner with 1:03 remaining.\n\n\\- On a late-game fourth-and-3 for the Jets, Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey drilled Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson to jar the ball loose and seal the Steelers' win.\n\n# [PHOTOS: Karl's top pics - Steelers at Jets](https://www.steelers.com/photos/photos-karl-s-top-pics-steelers-at-jets-x8049)\n\nTake a look at Karl's best photos from the Week 1 matchup against the New York Jets\n\n1 / 81\n\nPittsburgh Steelers running back Kaleb Johnson (20) prior to a regular season game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New York Jets, Sunday, Sept. 7, 2025 in East Rutherford, NJ.

Gainwell would add 35 receiving yards to his offensive display in this game in Dublin.\n\n\\- A short slant over the middle to Metcalf went 80 yards for a touchdown when the powerful receiver broke a tackle and outran the Vikings' secondary. He got a key block by Austin to finish the play and give the Steelers a 14-3 lead.\n\n\\- Harmon deflected a Carson Wentz pass that was intercepted by DeShon Elliott on a third-and-8 play in the middle of the second quarter.\n\n\\- Another big deflection by Heyward resulted in an interception by Watt at the line of scrimmage. He returned it 13 yards to the Minnesota 35 to set up ...\n\n\\- Gainwell's 4-yard TD run behind Pat Freiermuth and Spencer Anderson that gave the Steelers a 21-6 lead entering the fourth quarter.\n\n\\- The Vikings rallied, but were stymied by a tremendous hustle play by Wilson. The Steelers' inside linebacker ran down Vikings WR Jordan Addison from behind with a diving tackle at the Pittsburgh 1. The 81-yard catch-and-run by Addison eventually resulted in a fourth-down Vikings TD, but Wilson's hustle forced the Vikings to whittle more than a minute off the clock in a three-point game.\n\n\\- The Vikings got the ball one more time, and a Herbig pressure resulted in Wentz intentionally grounding the ball. The 15-yard penalty (and 10-second runoff) set up second-and-26 from which the Vikings couldn't recover. Elliott's pass breakup on fourth down sealed the win for the Steelers.\n\n# [PHOTOS: Karl's top pics - Steelers vs Vikings](https://www.steelers.com/photos/photos-karl-s-top-pics-steelers-vs-vikings)\n\nTake a look at Karl's best photos from the Week 4 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings\n\n1 / 90\n\nA general view during a regular season game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings, Sunday, Sept. 28, 2025 in Dublin, Ireland.

{"url": "https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-first-half-season-loaded-memorable-plays", "title": "First half of Steelers' season loaded with memorable plays", "content": "# First half of Steelers' season loaded with memorable plays\n\nNov 01, 2024 at 12:00 PM\n\n[Dale Lolley](https://www.steelers.com/author/dale-lolley)\n\nContributing Writer/Editor\n\n[Opens Twitter profile page in new window - Opens new window](https://twitter.com/dlolley_pgh)\n\n- Copied!\n\nThe Steelers head into their bye week at 6-2 and in first place in the AFC North.\n\nHow they have gotten to this point has been an interesting dichotomy of today's NFL.\n\nDuring a three-game winning streak to open the season, the defense was dominant, allowing just 26 total points.\n\nDuring a two-game losing streak, the defense, which had been the backbone of the winning streak to open the season, showed some leakage, giving up 27 and 20 points, too many for a team playing with its backup quarterback, as the Steelers were to open the season.\n\nBut during a three-game winning streak heading into the bye week, the offense, defense and special teams have all played in unison. That has led to some lopsided scores and the 6-2 record that has Steelers sitting atop the division, a position the team will hold when it next plays Nov. 10 at Washington regardless of what happens this weekend.\n\nAnd the Steelers have gotten there despite a number of injuries that could have sent the team into a spiral.\n\nTo wit, the offensive line has had four different players make their first career NFL start and has utilized five different starting combinations because of a number of injuries up front. Add to that games missed by, among others, outside linebackers Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig and running backs Jaylen Warren and Cordarrelle Patterson, let alone quarterback Russell Wilson missing the first six games of the season with a calf injury, and the it would be more understandable that the Steelers would be 2-6 instead of 6-2.\n\nWith Wilson injured, Justin Fields started the Steelers' first six games and helped the team to a 4-2 start, showing that the team's deft handling of the makeover of its quarterback room from 2023 was well worth the gamble.\n\nFields, just 10-28 as a starter in Chicago, accounted for 10 touchdowns and two turnovers in his six starts, while Wilson has thrown for three scores and rushed for another in his two starts.\n\nThe acquisition of those two quarterbacks – along with third-stringer Kyle Allen – were just three of the offseason moves made by GM Omar Khan. And all of his moves have largely paid dividends in the first half of the season.\n\nCornerback Donte Jackson, linebacker Patrick Queen and safety DeShon Elliott all have been major additions to the defense. So, too, has been third-round draft pick Payton Wilson at linebacker.\n\nOn the offensive side of things, first-round pick Troy Fautanu was unfortunately injured after making his first career start, but second-round selection Zach Frazier has arguably been the NFL's best rookie offensive lineman before missing the past two games with an ankle injury. He is expected to return after the bye week. Meanwhile, fourth-round selection Mason McCormick has moved into the starting lineup at right guard in place of an injured James Daniels, and has played well.\n\nWith all of that in mind, here are the top moments from an exciting first-half for the Steelers.\n\n_Week 1, 10:38 1st quarter, at Atlanta_\n\nThe Falcons came out and put together a nine-play drive that put them at the Pittsburgh 10 on the opening possession of the season. The Steelers were on the ropes, as Atlanta had a good plan to attack them with a mix of quick passes and the running game. But on first-and-goal from the 10, T.J. Watt whipped his block at the line of scrimmage and broke into the backfield to stop Bijan Robinson in his tracks for a 3-yard loss. The Falcons were forced to settle for a field goal and the Steelers went on to win, 18-10.\n\n_Week 1, 2:49 4th quarter, at Atlanta_\n\nWith the Steelers leading, 15-10, Atlanta had the ball at the Pittsburgh 47 with a chance to perhaps win the game. But Donte Jackson had other plans. He intercepted a Kirk Cousins pass intended for Ray-Ray McCloud and returned the ball 49 yards to the Atlanta 18. The Steelers forced the Falcons to use all of their timeouts and ran the clock down to 29 seconds before Chris Boswell booted his sixth field goal of the game – three of which came from 50 or more yards – to help secure the win.\n\n_Week 2, 2:01 1st quarter, at Denver_\n\nFields finds 6-foot-8 tight end Darnell Washington in the front left corner of the end zone for a bunch of firsts. It's the Steelers' first touchdown of the season. It's Fields' first touchdown pass with the Steelers. It's Washington's first career touchdown reception. The touchdown would be the only one they would need as they beat the Broncos, 13-7, to move to 2-0.\n\n_Week 3, 7:53 3rd quarter, against Los Angeles Chargers_\n\nWith the Steelers and Chargers tied at 10-10, the two teams traded turnovers. The Steelers get a strip-sack and fumbled recovery from Nick Herbig, but the Chargers' Bud Dupree intercepts a tipped Fields' pass to give the ball right back to Los Angeles. On first down, Elandon Roberts sacks Justin Herbert, aggravating a previous ankle injury for the quarterback. The Chargers run the ball two more times, punt and don't threaten the Steelers again.\n\n_Week 3, 7:12 4th quarter, against Los Angeles Chargers_\n\nWith the Steelers leading 13-10, Fields drops back to pass on second-and-7. George Pickens draws the safety outside, allowing Calvin Austin III to get to the middle of the field by himself. Fields puts the ball on the speedy Austin and he goes 55 yards for a touchdown to put the game out of reach.\n\n_Week 4, :30 1st quarter, at Indianapolis_\n\nWith the Steelers trailing 14-0, Mike Tomlin chooses to roll the dice and try to pick up fourth-and-inches at his own 39. Fields is tackled on the quarterback keeper short of the line to gain by linebacker Zaire Franklin, and though the defense holds the Colts to a field goal, the Steelers fall into a 17-0 hole. The Steelers would rally from that deficit, but still lose, 27-24.\n\n_Week 5, 5:00 4th quarter, against Dallas_\n\nWith the Steelers trailing, 13-10, Joey Porter picked off a deep pass from Dak Prescott and returned it to the Pittsburgh 37. Twelve plays later, Fields threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Pat Freiermuth to put the Steelers ahead, 17-13.\n\n_Week 5, :37 4th quarter, against Dallas_\n\nWith the Cowboys threatening to score on second-and-goal from the 1, Roberts shoots through the middle of the line and nails Rico Dowdle in the hold, forcing a fumble. Prescott fell on the loose ball, beating several Steelers to it. Two plays later, he tosses a 4-yard touchdown, 4th-down pass to Jalen Tolbert, who holds onto the ball despite an attempt from Elliott to strip it out, to give Dallas the lead, 20-17.\n\n_Week 6, 4:33 3rd quarter, at Las Vegas_\n\nLeading 15-7 midway through the third quarter, the Steelers turned to running back Najee Harris to bludgeon the Las Vegas defense. On second-and-10 on the drive's second play, Harris busted loose for a 26-yard run to the Pittsburgh 46. Five plays later on second-and-5, Harris took a handoff through the middle of the line, broke left to the outside and raced down the sideline for the end zone, diving the final 5 yards and break the plane of the goal for a 36-yard touchdown run and a 22-7 Steelers' lead. It was Harris' first touchdown of the season and broke the game open.\n\n_Week 6, 8:32 4th quarter, at Las Vegas_\n\nWith the Steelers leading, 22-7, the Raiders were trying to get back into the game. But Jackson had other plans. He picked off Aidan O'Connell and returned the ball 24 yards to the Las Vegas 7. One play later, Fields scored on a 7-yard run to put the Steelers ahead, 29-7.\n\n_Week 7, 11:35 2nd quarter, against New York Jets_\n\nIn Wilson's first game back after sitting out the first six with a calf injury, the Steelers scored on their opening possession, getting a field goal. But the next three possessions resulted in three-and-outs and the fans at Acrisure Stadium were getting restless. After a holding penalty pushed the Steelers back on their next possession, things looked bleak, as the Steelers faced second-and-17. But Wilson took a deep shot down the sideline to his left in front of the Steelers bench to Pickens working one-on-one against cornerback Brandin Echols. Pickens shielded Echols off with his body and hauled the pass in for a 44-yard gain to the New York 32. The drive resulted in a field goal, but it seemed to ignite Wilson, who was just 2 of 8 passing to that point.\n\n_Week 7, 1:26 2nd quarter, against New York Jets_\n\nNew York held a 15-6 lead and had the football looking for more at the end of the first half, knowing it also would get the football to start the second half. But on second-and-4 from the New York 36, Aaron Rodgers wanted to throw a pass over the middle for Garrett Wilson. But defensive tackle Cam Heyward got his hands up, forcing Rodgers to double-clutch on the pass. That gave Beanie Bishop the opportunity to step underneath Garrett Wilson and intercept the pass at the Pittsburgh 46. Four plays later, Russell Wilson tossed an 11-yard TD to George Pickens, cutting New York's lead to 15-13 and starting a run of 31 consecutive points for the Steelers. Bishop also would pick off Rodgers in the third quarter to set up another touchdown.\n\n_•_ _Dale Lolley is co-host of \"SNR Drive\" on Steelers Nation Radio.

But Greg Zuerlein's attempt was blocked by defensive lineman Dean Lowry, turning the Jets away without points. It marked the third consecutive game in which the Steelers blocked a kick, tying a team record for most blocks in consecutive games and blocks in a single season.\n\n_Week 8, 4:58 3rd quarter, against New York Giants_\n\nThe Steelers were locked in a 9-9 tie with the visiting Giants when an Alex Highsmith sack helped force New York to punt. Austin fielded the punt at his own 27 on the right hash, cut all the way back across the field, picking up a block on the edge from Rodney Williams and sprinted up the sideline for a 73-yard punt return touchdown. It was the Steelers' first punt return for a score since 2019. On the Steelers' next possession, Austin would catch a 29-yard touchdown pass from Wilson, helping the Steelers to their sixth win.\n\n_Week 8, 3:03 4th quarter, against New York Giants_\n\nWith the Steelers leading 26-18, Wilson fumbled on a scramble, with the Giants recovering at the Pittsburgh 37. But with the Giants at the 19, Watt whipped his block at the snap, hit quarterback Daniel Jones and forced him to fumble, recovering the loose ball himself. The Steelers would run the clock down to two minutes while moving out to midfield before punting. And Bishop would record his third interception in two weeks in the closing seconds to seal the win for the Steelers.\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/rj2x6jlmd2sgprf4yxxo.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Winning while building**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Steelers head into their bye week with a 3-1 record](https://www.steelers.com/news/winning-while-building \"Winning while building\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/i7btzicosviyf83wurca.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Five Fast Facts: Brandin Echols**\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn more about Brandin Echols in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-brandin-echols \"Five Fast Facts: Brandin Echols\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/hxpq5fwt6jwfdmbzs7m5.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Five Fast Facts: Darius Slay**\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn more about Darius Slay in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-darius-slay \"Five Fast Facts: Darius Slay\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/gfbre5360twmbebktymu.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Five Fast Facts: Kaleb Johnson**\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn more about Kaleb Johnson in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-kaleb-johnson \"Five Fast Facts: Kaleb Johnson\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**The voice of experience**\\\\\n\\\\\nSeumalo's play, presence counted upon to steady youngsters up front](https://www.steelers.com/news/the-voice-of-experience \"The voice of experience\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Five Fast Facts: Malik Harrison**\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn more about Malik Harrison in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-malik-harrison \"Five Fast Facts: Malik Harrison\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Heyward ranked No. 83 on the NFL Top 100 List**\\\\\n\\\\\nCameron Heyward is ranked No. 83 on the NFL Top 100 List of 2025](https://www.steelers.com/news/heyward-ranked-no-83-on-the-nfl-top-100-list \"Heyward ranked No. 83 on the NFL Top 100 List\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Five Fast Facts: Donte Kent**\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn more about Donte Kent in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-donte-kent \"Five Fast Facts: Donte Kent\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Five Fast Facts: Mason Rudolph**\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn more about Mason Rudolph in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-mason-rudolph \"Five Fast Facts: Mason Rudolph\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**WATCH: 13 minutes of Rodgers highlights**\\\\\n\\\\\nEnjoy 13 straight minutes of Aaron Rodgers highlights](https://www.steelers.com/news/watch-13-minutes-of-rodgers-highlights \"WATCH: 13 minutes of Rodgers highlights\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Five Fast Facts: Skylar Thompson**\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn more about Skylar Thompson in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-skylar-thompson \"Five Fast Facts: Skylar Thompson\")\n\n[![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Five Fast Facts: Will Howard**\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn more about Will Howard in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-will-howard \"Five Fast Facts: Will Howard\")\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdvertising", "source_category": "sports", "source_root_url": "https://www.steelers.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:35:10.311422", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 14756, "cleaned_content_length": 14632, "word_count": 2246, "char_count": 14632, "description": "These were many of the key moments in the Steelers' 6-2 start", "event_date": "Nov 01, 2024", "event_time": "12:00 PM"}}

They've done a fantastic job working with Will and helping him get back. The strength and conditioning from a lifting standpoint, running standpoint, also doing just drill work with him. They've really kept him up to speed.\n\n\"He's in great shape right now, and he's in as good a shape as he's been since he's been a Pittsburgh Steeler and he has been doing everything that he can.\n\n\"It was disappointing, but that's football and that's just sometimes the way it goes. Sure, we would have loved to have seen him play and compete. He had a great training camp, great off season and we expected him to go into the preseason and perform very well. And it was disappointing that we didn't get a chance to see that come to fruition.\n\n\"But he's maximized this time that he's had. I think he's continued to improve physically and mentally, so whenever he's available and if he's able to come back and practice at any point, I'm sure he'll be ready to go.\"\n\nDespite not getting on the field, though, he has contributed in ways that are hard to measure.\n\nHoward has been a constant in meetings, at practice and games, providing help for quarterback Aaron Rodgers and the offense.\n\n\"From a mental standpoint, he's been doing some special projects for Aaron,\" said Arth. \"He's been really locked in mentally to our plan, really locked into our opponent, has been able to help Aaron out in some really great ways and he been able to help our coaching staff. So, he's done a nice job.\"\n\nWhile Howard has done what he can to help Rodgers and the offense, Rodgers in turn has been a source of every bit of information he needs.\n\nThe veteran quarterback has taken the rookie under his wing, showing him the tricks of the trade and being an open book.\n\n\"Will sits right next to him in our meeting room,\" said Arth. \"He stands as close to him as he can at practice every single day. He just soaks it all in and Aaron's been awesome in that regard as well. He's just been so open with Will and with all the quarterbacks honestly, in terms of sharing some small little details of what he does. Just some of the shortcuts and tricks that he's picked up throughout the years that have helped him, and I just think it's been awesome for all of us.\"\n\nOn Rodgers' accuracy and ability to hit a receiver in the right spot:\n\n\"When you're evaluating a quarterback, his ability to put the ball in the proper location to allow receivers to run through catches, to throw receivers open is important. I think the one thing about the NFL that I learned really early, there's no such thing as 'more open' in the NFL. Either you are or you aren't and that just speaks to the ball placement piece. Whether that's a back shoulder throw, or just understanding defender's hips and shoulders and vision and things like that.\n\n\"That's something that Aaron does extraordinarily well. And then to be able to put the ball on a crossing route or a breaking route and to be able to put it on his up-field shoulder and allow him to run through it and not break stride.\n\n\"I think you saw that in DK's (Metcalf) touchdown this past weekend. If that ball's behind him at all, it may not be an 80-yard touchdown, maybe a first down. So, ball placement accuracy is everything.\"\n\nOn Rodgers standing behind the offense, hands on hips, and signally for a first down on the Connor Heyward 'tush push' play:\n\n\"I think he was pretty happy to stand there in the background and just signal first down. If you guys saw that it was pretty funny. Aaron's super competitive and I'm sure that he always wants the ball in his hands or wants to contribute in any way that he can.\n\n\"I did not notice it on the field until we're on the plane flying home and I saw it on tape. But that's one of the things you love about Aaron is he has fun. He enjoys the game and it's great to see him out there enjoying it and having fun and he's still playing like he's a young kid in the backyard.\n\n\"It's those little things you would think after 21 years that maybe a player wouldn't find as much joy in the game and that's what's been so amazing for me to coach him is he makes it really fun. He loves to compete, he loves to play, he loves to practice and it's awesome to be a part of.\"\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/j6kw0fymx2bonoiszwi1.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**WATCH: The Mike Tomlin Show -

But it still wasn't enough for the Steelers to escape with a victory, as they turned the ball over four times and lost their third consecutive game.\n\n\"We just didn't make the plays that needed to be made,\" said linebacker Alex Highsmith, who had the Steelers' only sack in the game, giving him 5.5 for the season.\n\nPickett's first career pass was intercepted by former Pitt teammate and current Jets safety Jordan Whitehead on a deep pass intended for Chase Claypool. Claypool and a defender leaped for the pass at the New York 10, but it tipped off their hands and into those of Whitehead.\n\nBut Minkah Fitzpatrick returned the favor, intercepting Zach Wilson off a pass that tipped off the hands of tight end Tyler Conklin, returning it 34 yards to the New York 4.\n\nPickett scored from inside the 1 on third down on a QB sneak to give the Steelers their first lead, 13-10, with 7:18 remaining in the third quarter.\n\n\"Kenny gave us a spark,\" said Claypool. \"You could feel the energy in the stadium when he was in there.\"\n\nThe defense again held up, forcing the Jets (2-2) to punt and Pickett directed an 82-yard touchdown drive, finishing it off himself again with his second touchdown run, this one from 2 yards out to give the Steelers a 20-10 lead with 13:36 remaining in the game.\n\nPickett converted three third downs on the drive, once on a scramble, with the second two coming on passes to fellow rookie George Pickens and tight end Pat Freiermuth.\n\nThe Jets answered that with a touchdown of their own, converting three third-downs on an 81-yard drive, scoring on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Wilson to wide receiver Corey Davis with 7:31 remaining in the fourth quarter to make it 20-17.\n\nPickett was then intercepted on the Steelers' next possession with the team driving to put the game away. Pickett's second-down pass from the New York 36 was high to Freiermuth and tipped off his hands and into the waiting arms of safety Michael Carter, giving the Jets the ball back at their own 35 with just under four minutes remaining in the game.\n\n\"(I'm) Just disappointed,\" Pickett said. \"(I) Wanted to come in and get the win. So, that's really just the emotions. (It's) Definitely something we need to learn from and move on.\"\n\nThe Jets drove 65 yards for a 2-yard touchdown run by running back Breece Hall with 16 seconds remaining to put New York ahead 24-20.\n\nThe Steelers got the ball to midfield on the game's final play, but Pickett's final desperation pass was intercepted in the end zone.\n\n\"I thought he did some good things,\" Tomlin said of Pickett's performance. \"I thought there was some energy there. We scored some touchdowns. But, obviously, we also turned the ball over.\"\n\nThe Steelers had a promising drive going on the game's opening possession, but were penalized for guard James Daniels being downfield early on a run-pass option play after moving into New York territory and were forced to punt.\n\nThe Steelers forced a three-and-out on New York's first possession, but after a punt, Trubisky's pass on first-and-10 deflected off the hands of Diontae Johnson and into the hands of Jets safety Lamarcus Joyner for an interception.\n\nThat set up a 38-yard field goal by Greg Zeuerlein that gave the Jets a 3-0 lead.\n\nThey grabbed a 10-0 lead on their next possession, driving 70 yards, with Wilson connecting with Elijah Moore for a 20-yard gain on third-and-7 from the New York 33 being the play that kick-started the series. Wilson capped the possession off by catching a 2-yard touchdown pass from wide receiver Braxton Berrios, who had taken a pitch on a double reverse, to give New York a 10-0 lead early in the second quarter.\n\nThe Steelers finally got on the board, scoring on their ensuing possession, though it wasn't the touchdown they had hoped for. Trubisky threw a 23-yard pass to Johnson in the back of the end zone that was initially ruled an incompletion, but Tomlin challenged the play. Replay showed the front of Johnson's foot was narrowly out of bounds while he drug his back foot and the play call was upheld.\n\nInstead, the Steelers settled for a 51-yard Boswell field goal that cut the Jets' advantage to 10-3.\n\nThe Jets appeared to be poised to increase their advantage just before the half, but Cam Sutton intercepted a Wilson pass inside the Pittsburgh 10 and returned it 26 yards to the 30, giving the Steelers the ball back with 20 seconds left in the second quarter.\n\nTrubisky completed a 14-yard pass to Freiermuth, but his final pass, a Hail Mary attempt, was intercepted. However, Jets defensive end Carl Lawson was called for roughing Trubisky on the play, moving the ball to the New York 41, and Boswell kicked a 59-yard field goal to make it 10-6 at the half.\n\nThe field goal matched the longest of Boswell's career and in team history.\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/m3szlm1zt3cdjcz9l4fj.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Steelers defeat Vikings, 24-21, in Ireland**\\\\\n\\\\\nEffective run game, playmaking defense key 24-21 win](https://www.steelers.com/news/steelers-defeat-vikings-24-21-in-ireland \"Steelers defeat Vikings, 24-21, in Ireland\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/uajgbxjdbi1seaylqt4j.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Steelers defeat the Patriots, 21-14**\\\\\n\\\\\nDefense forces four fumbles;

I also believe Washington's contribution as a blocker was a real factor in the success of the running game, which is a significant element that the Steelers are going to need if they are to make any kind of run in the playoffs. My opinion is that the Steelers' see Washington as a valuable component of the running game, and I also could imagine seeing his contributions on passing plays being to help keep Rodgers upright. Not all the time, but I'm just not sure that Washington is going to be used primarily as a receiving tight end. In fact, I suspect it's going to be the opposite.\n\n- _Download and listen to the Asked & Answered Podcast here:_ [Apple Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/asked-answered/id1585047039) \\| [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/55uD4pFAR39xIH5hCnI1Vo)\n\n**RICK BURTON FROM MERIDIAN, MS: Born and raised in Duquesne, Pa., I saw many a Steelers game at Forbes Field or Pitt Stadium and enjoyed each one. I still bleed black-and-gold every Sunday. Played the game for 14 years through college. That being said I simply do not see why some Steelers fans cannot just enjoy the positives of our Steelers as they grow as a team as the season progresses. Some fans want November/December football in September (some even preseason). The Steelers have had only 8 coaches in my lifetime (1945 to present) and only 3 the last 56 years. How does that compare to the rest of the NFL?**\n\nANSWER: Three coaches in 56 seasons is by far the fewest of any NFL team during that time, and you're going to have to take my word for it because there was no way I was digging through those weeds. And while 3 coaches in 56 years is a unique stat, when you add in that each of those 3 coaches in 56 years won at least 1 Super Bowl, you've got to give props to the people who identified the candidates and then made the hire.\n\n**DAVE HYSLIP FROM PITTSBURGH, PA: With the Steelers game in Dublin being such a roaring success on both sides of the pond, and from the business standpoint, expanding the NFL brand internationally a continued success, it's easy to see where this could be heading in the future. This might be more of a \"think about it\" than a question, but imagine one of the Steelers regular home games every year being played in Ireland?**\n\nANSWER: Since we're \"thinking about it,\" I don't think the Steelers ever would have an annual International Game, because a team like Jacksonville has an annual International; Game because the Jaguars were having trouble selling tickets to their home games. I can't see the Steelers wanting to take a home game out of Pittsburgh every year, and I don't believe the NFL would be in favor of that either. Just what I 'think.\"\n\n**ROBERT KLACZAK FROM PALMYRA, PA: Kickoffs are consistently landing around the 1-yard line. Why do the kickoff returners not line up a few yards into the end zone and get a running start when they catch the ball? They would get up to full speed more quickly and likely get a longer return.**\n\nANSWER: Theoretically that is correct, but what if the kickoff isn't kicked directly to a returner, and so getting a running start also might involve running on an angle. Those would be harder to catch and secure, and harder to block for because everything could change as the ball is kicked. If it's blocked correctly, and the returner hits the crease that's created, you have a chance at a big return with less risk.\n\n**JOHN SUSKO FROM NAPLES, FL: Will the Steelers activate Will Howard and place Skylar Thompson on injured reserve?**\n\nANSWER: Skylar Thompson already is on injured reserve. The Steelers have 2 QBs on their 53-man roster – Aaron Rodgers and Mason Rudolph. Logan Woodside is on the practice squad.\n\n**SCOTT BEACHAM FROM CHICAGO, IL: I'm wondering what the Steelers can do now that Will Howard is available to come off IR? We can't sign him to the practice squad, and I cannot imagine adding him to the 53-man roster. Can the Steelers just keep him on IR for remainder of the season since he won't play anyway?**\n\nANSWER: I cannot tell you what the Steelers are going to do with Will Howard, except to say I am confident they are not going to expose him to waivers.\n\n**GRANT MOORE FROM ZANESVILLE, OH: I am a huge fan of \"what if\" stories. So, I got a \"what if\" question for you. What if the Steelers beat the Packers in Super Bowl XLV?**\n\nANSWER: If the Steelers had defeated the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV, they would have seven Lombardi Trophies instead of six.\n\n**RICHARD SHARRATT FROM REDCAR, ENGLAND: Does a blocked field goal count as a miss on the kicker's stats?**\n\nANSWER: Yes, it does.\n\n**MIKE REIBMAN FROM MERRICK, NY: After his big effort play on Sunday against the Vikings, have you started getting questions about moving Payton Wilson to safety yet?**\n\nANSWER: I think that went away when fans saw how effective and dynamic Ryan Shazier was at the inside linebacker position.\n\n**WILLIAM GRAY FROM GALENA, IL: The highs and lows we go through as Steelers fans certainly lend credence to the word fanatic. You often bear the brunt of this through forums like this. As the wise old seer of all things Steelers, can you tell me when I will be able to just watch a game and relax, or is that feat accomplished only with a hefty supply of antacid and Jameson?**\n\nANSWER: Covering Steelers games for various media outlets has been my job for more than half of my life. I don't watch games as a fan, nor do I watch games with fans. The approach, the experience of it being your job is the polar opposite to watching a game among fans or as a fan. I would be willing to bet on the day after the Steelers win a Super Bowl that I will be getting submissions from people complaining about some aspect of their performance, or discounting the win as lucky, or coming at me with \"What if they didn't have five takeaways? The defense is awful.\" So, I guess it's up to you whether can watch a Steelers game and relax. The Jameson is up to you.\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/sty8xfahxtbrzedsvxv8.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Sept. 30**\\\\\n\\\\\nThere was no penalty flag thrown when T.J. punted the ball into the Croke Park stands](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-sept-30-x1913 \"Asked and Answered: Sept. 30\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/v3ix3bbiowgvjzqlm0ae.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Sept. 28**\\\\\n\\\\\nHeyward, Tomlin walking off the field together has become their tradition](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-sept-28-x0078 \"Asked and Answered: Sept. 28\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/tbvsprxfefah24obz7wc.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Sept. 25**\\\\\n\\\\\nCalling for the snap on a FG or PAT change to make it tougher to block the kick](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-sept-25 \"Asked and Answered: Sept. 25\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/k21uhyxjbuidamw44gdb.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Sept. 23**\\\\\n\\\\\nWhat looked so easy during the first two drives suddenly became quite difficult](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-sept-23-x1219 \"Asked and Answered: Sept. 23\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/vnwrt4pfgd0tvwvu5lvp.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Sept. 21**\\\\\n\\\\\nMany readers took the time to express appreciation and offer tributes to Dale Lolley](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-sept-21-x2319 \"Asked and Answered: Sept. 21\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/lecq8pq3qabppr3psrkh.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Sept. 18**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe story is the NFL first approached the Steelers about being 'America's Team'](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-sept-18-x2484 \"Asked and Answered: Sept. 18\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/rsou5ewy4gfno3avhnhv.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Sept. 16**\\\\\n\\\\\nBack in 1990, another Steelers rookie RB had a costly brain cramp on a kickoff](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-sept-16-x4020 \"Asked and Answered: Sept. 16\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/krc4czii7edmtsqour9n.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Sept. 14**\\\\\n\\\\\nCircumstances likely led to Watt being used the way he was vs. the Jets](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-sept-14-x8443 \"Asked and Answered: Sept. 14\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/tu9kzraehk3lq6cfevtd.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Sept. 11**\\\\\n\\\\\nBrown moved from TE to RT only after given a whole offseason to prepare](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-sept-11-x0697 \"Asked and Answered: Sept. 11\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/yg3vbwqlgh9wqorfopee.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Sept. 9**\\\\\n\\\\\nBoswell's game-winner vs. Jets was both a career long and a franchise record](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-sept-9-x2701 \"Asked and Answered: Sept. 9\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/private/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/q6yssgxrhdokjy0wvtsz.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Sept. 7**\\\\\n\\\\\nHarrison went from waivers to 2008's Defensive Player of the Year](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-aug-7-x5412 \"Asked and Answered: Sept. 7\")\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdvertising", "source_category": "sports", "source_root_url": "https://www.steelers.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:35:10.334047", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 10643, "cleaned_content_length": 10526, "word_count": 1496, "char_count": 10526, "description": "Washington's blocking can be a component of establishing an effective running game", "event_date": "Oct 02, 2025", "event_time": "06:05 AM"}}

Kennedy for President\" poster from 1960 on one wall and a bronze representation of James Joyce in front of another.\n\nWelcome to Dublin.\n\n———\n\nThis wasn't, after further review, where the streets had no name.\n\nAnd the names were all recognizable to the Steelers fans crowding up and down the cobblestones of the Temple Bar district, touring the Guinness Storehouse or visiting Christ Church Cathedral, Trinity College or any of the numerous other local attractions.\n\nThe nameplates and numbers on the backs of authentic jerseys were omnipresent.\n\n\"Roethlisberger 7,\" and \"Bettis 36\" and \"Greene 75\" and \"Russell 34,\" to name just a few; almost every era of Steelers football, it seemed, was on display.\n\nAnd it wasn't just fans celebrating their favorite players.\n\nA host of former Steelers were there in the flesh.\n\nThe group included Bettis, Mark Bruener, James Farrior, Brett Keisel, Carnell Lake, Maurice Pouncey, Roethlisberger, John Stallworth, Max Starks and Ike Taylor.\n\nThey enthusiastically showed up for events such as football camps (including one in Belfast, Northern Ireland), Q&A's at Fitzsimons Pub, a flag football event at the U.S. Ambassador's residence and a tailgate. The ex-players sampled a pint or two and served as good will ambassadors throughout.\n\nThey didn't want to miss this, either.\n\nFitzsimons served as an unofficial headquarters for Steelers fans and hosted broadcasts on Steelers Nation Radio and WDVE-FM in Pittsburgh, the flagship station on the Steelers Audio Network, and Steelers fans responded.\n\nAccording to Romy Carroll, manager of sales and marketing for Fitzsimons, business was up about 50 percent over an average weekend and surpassed annual events such as St. Patrick's Day and the All-Ireland Finals for rugby and Gaelic football (which draw sellout crowds to Croke Park, the venue for the Steelers-Vikings game) in terms of attendance and, perhaps, merriment.\n\n\"We are known as the biggest and best live entertainment venue in Temple Bar and have been nominated for many awards, including 'The Best Live Entertainment Venue' in Dublin,\" Carroll explained. \"But this weekend the award has to go to the outstanding Steelers fans who came over to Ireland in droves because of the passion they have for Pittsburgh, the love of the game and most of all the historic Irish connection the Steelers have to our country.\"\n\nDid anyone expect anything less?\n\n\"It just shows the support that Steelers Nation gets, from not only the crowds but the former players,\" maintained Bruener, a former tight end, a current scout for the Steelers and the father of rookie Steelers linebacker Carson Bruener. \"It also shows how the players are treated by the organization, by the Rooney family. You could probably poll a lot of players that have played for a lot of different (Steelers) teams and I think the common comments that you're going to get from former players is the way they're treated by the Rooney family.\n\n\"This is a tough business, let's be clear, but you can still treat people the right way. And former players, if they played with us for a year or they played with us for a decade, they all have the same type of sentiments toward the team and the way they're treated by the team. And that allegiance carries over to a game like this here in Ireland.\"\n\nBruener was asked if the Steelers reach out to alumni in situations such as the historic Ireland trip.\n\n\"I think it was more (the former players) saying, 'Please, can I come? And is there anything I can do?' That's the way we are, the way the Steeler family is.\"\n\nAdded Pouncey: \"I'm beyond grateful. The people here, the hospitality, this has been beyond a blessing for us.\"\n\n———\n\nFor this writer, and some others, the journey across the pond started in, of all places, Cleveland.\n\nDirect flights on Aer Lingus bound for Dublin were available at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and many western Pennsylvanians took full advantage.\n\nNo wonder an exasperated bartender at one of the Hopkins' establishments wondered aloud, \"Why is everyone in here wearing a Steelers jersey?\"\n\nThere were fans from all over the world at the game, especially the host nation.\n\nBut there was an atypical number of Steelers fans in attendance for such an NFL event, fans whose next game is as likely to be at Acrisure Stadium as anywhere else.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell detailed the departure from the norm in an interview with sideline reporter Missi Matthews on the Steelers Audio Network Pregame Show.\n\nFor international games, \"We normally have most of our fans coming from the country that we're playing in, and that's why we're playing it,\" Goodell maintained. \"This game is different. I think one-third of the crowd here today came from the (United) States, and I think it'll be pretty Steeler-heavy.\n\n\"I'm not surprised, they travel better than any team in the NFL, probably.\"\n\nHe wasn't wrong, either.\n\nIn what was officially a home game for the Steelers, the Steelers' crowd took over at Croke Park.\n\nThe Vikings were the team that had to resort with regularity to the silent count (although the Steelers had to on occasion, as well, such was the level of exuberance).\n\nAnd the Steelers played, not a complete game but one that was much more in tune with what they've been after all along than what they'd been able to muster in the season's first three weeks.\n\nThey may have let a 24-6, fourth-quarter lead dwindle to three, the game may have come down to one final defensive stop and ended up being \"a little more entertaining than maybe it should have been,\" as head coach Mike Tomlin acknowledged.\n\nBut in the end it was a beautiful day.\n\nThey found much if not all of what they're looking for.\n\nRe-Joyce.\n\nSometimes, the longest way 'round really is the shortest way home.\n\n## Related

{"url": "https://www.steelers.com/news/an-unselfish-group", "title": "An unselfish group", "content": "# An unselfish group\n\nOct 02, 2025 at 04:00 PM\n\n[Teresa Varley](https://www.steelers.com/author/teresa-varley)\n\nSteelers.com\n\n[Opens Twitter profile page in new window - Opens new window](https://twitter.com/Teresa_Varley)[Opens Instagram profile page in new window - Opens new window](https://www.instagram.com/teresavarley/)\n\n- Copied!\n\nSteelers fans saw on Sunday what DK Metcalf brings to the offense when he broke loose for an 80-yard touchdown reception against the Minnesota Vikings, speeding down the sidelines for the score.\n\nReceivers coach Zach Azzanni jokingly said he would like to take credit for Metcalf's yards after catch because they put so much focus on it every practice, but he said it was all Metcalf.\n\n\"We work on it a lot. We emphasize it a lot, every drill that we do, every route,\" said Azzanni. \"I show film of it throughout the week, of other teams, of us. We talk about all of that.\n\n\"I would love to tell you that DK was all coaching, but that one, it was him. I got a lot teasing about that. But we do coach it, we emphasize it just like everyone else in the league does it, but those guys make it breathe.\"\n\nAnd what Metcalf has brought to the offense, in the words of Azzanni is a breath of fresh air.\n\nMetcalf, who was acquired in a trade with the Seattle Seahawks this offseason, has a business-like approach to the game, wanting nothing more than to win every week.\n\n\"It's been a pleasure,\" said Azzanni of working with Metcalf. \"It's a breath of fresh air. He's great to work with. He's a true pro. He does anything you ask him to do. He's a team guy, which is really cool.\n\n\"He gets as excited when other guys make plays as he does when he makes a play. And when you have a room like that with a lot of guys and your bell cow is wired like that, it's a pleasure to coach.\n\n\"It's fun to go in the meeting room. No one's too prideful to take corrections. So, it's been a really good addition having him there.\"\n\nIt's an attitude Azzanni said permeates not just with Metcalf, but throughout the entire receiver room, including Calvin Austin III, Roman Wilson, Scotty Miller and Ben Skowronek.\n\nAnd their performance reflects that.\n\n\"These guys are just doing what they're asked to do, which is cool,\" said Azzanni. \"The goal is to win football games. If they block 40 times, they block 40 times We throw 40 times, we throw 40 and none of them say a word.\n\n\"They're a very unselfish group. It's a really good room. So, I feel good about where they are.\"\n\nAnother player who epitomizes that unselfish approach is Skowronek. He might not get the numbers in the receiving game, but he contributes in ways that are hard to measure.\n\n\"Ben's the kind of guy that you don't want on other teams,\" said Azzanni. \"You like it on your team. He's a guy that does all the dirty work. He is the goon, if you will. And he is a sneaky good receiver too.\n\n\"He is a talented kid. People don't give him enough credit for that because of the other things that he does so well on special teams and carrying the run fight for us. But he's also a very talented receiver, which he proved in college.\n\n\"He's great. He is a big personality. He's fun to have in the room.\n\n\"Between him and DK going at each other in fun and playful ways. It makes it a lot of fun having him. I'm glad he's on our team.\"\n\nAnother receiver who could be asked to step up in the near future with Austin now dealing with a shoulder injury is Wilson. The second-year receiver out of Michigan is emerging, even if he hasn't had a lot of opportunities yet.\n\n\"Roman's progressing,\" said Azzanni. \"He's doing a good job. Roman's doing just fine. We just happen to be pretty good at tight end and wideout and what we're doing running the ball.\n\n\"But Roman, he's in the mix, just like all the other guys. Obviously, his role keeps elevating as the season goes on. It'll just start to happen, and I just tell him when it happens, be ready.\"\n\n## Related Content\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/j6kw0fymx2bonoiszwi1.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**WATCH: The Mike Tomlin Show - Bye Week**\\\\\n\\\\\nBob Pompeani and Missi Matthews talk about where the Steelers sit at their Week 5 bye week](https://www.steelers.com/news/watch-the-mike-tomlin-show-bye-week-x5185 \"WATCH: The Mike Tomlin Show - Bye Week\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_png/steelers/d0achl03lbh12srdik2r.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**WATCH: SNR Drive Trending Topics (Week 5)**\\\\\n\\\\\nMatt Williamson and Wes Uhler recapped the Steelers trip to Ireland, their win over the Vikings, talked about the defense and more on SNR Drive this week](https://www.steelers.com/news/watch-snr-drive-trending-topics-week-5 \"WATCH: SNR Drive Trending Topics (Week 5)\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/rj2x6jlmd2sgprf4yxxo.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Winning while building**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Steelers head into their bye week with a 3-1 record](https://www.steelers.com/news/winning-while-building \"Winning while building\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/syc5g76wpers8hzkfrfz.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Irish eyes were smiling**\\\\\n\\\\\nMike Prisuta of the Steelers Audio Network looks back at a trip to remember](https://www.steelers.com/news/irish-eyes-were-smiling-x9038 \"Irish eyes were smiling\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/r5wihqhpcp1ymzo4baj2.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**A week to remember on the Emerald Isle**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Steelers visit to the island of Ireland in Week 4 was certainly one to remember](https://www.steelers.com/news/a-week-to-remember-on-the-emerald-isle \"A week to remember on the Emerald Isle\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/lnlplktqmvkyla0ej66j.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**WATCH: SNR Drive (Oct. 2)**\\\\\n\\\\\nMatt Williamson and Wes Uhler look at the numbers from the season so far and more on SNR Drive](https://www.steelers.com/news/watch-snr-drive-oct-2-x0457 \"WATCH: SNR Drive (Oct. 2)\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/fj93nczuzno8fmvlrqmt.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Martin: 'He can do everything'**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe Steelers have three big-time edge-rushers](https://www.steelers.com/news/martin-he-can-do-everything \"Martin: 'He can do everything'\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/ce2zeemifqylx9qocbv7.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Metcalf, Elliott are co-captains for Steelers Style**\\\\\n\\\\\nDK Metcalf and DeShon Elliott will serve as co-captains for Steelers Style](https://www.steelers.com/news/metcalf-elliott-are-co-captains-for-steelers-style \"Metcalf, Elliott are co-captains for Steelers Style\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_png/steelers/ae2mw2pduxgtpsetp8mo.png)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Next men up**\\\\\n\\\\\nThe running backs stepped up big against the Vikings with Jaylen Warren out](https://www.steelers.com/news/next-men-up-x7611 \"Next men up\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/a5xjaonewdj5is4xklz8.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**Asked and Answered: Oct. 2**\\\\\n\\\\\nWashington's blocking can be a component of establishing an effective running game](https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-oct-2-x2752 \"Asked and Answered: Oct. 2\")\n\n[![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/f_auto/steelers/z7dmeip8oxgflgazbtbn.jpg)\\\\\n\\\\\nnews\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n**WATCH: SNR Drive (Oct. 1)**\\\\\n\\\\\nMatt Williamson and Wes Uhler talk about what they noticed after re-watching Steelers vs Vikings and more on SNR Drive](https://www.steelers.com/news/watch-snr-drive-oct-1-x2983 \"WATCH: SNR Drive (Oct. 1)\")\n\nAdvertising\n\nAdvertising", "source_category": "sports", "source_root_url": "https://www.steelers.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:35:10.346869", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 8052, "cleaned_content_length": 7935, "word_count": 1067, "char_count": 7935, "description": "The Steelers receivers have an approach where it's all about winning", "event_date": "Oct 02, 2025", "event_time": "04:00 PM"}}
