Visit the Fort Pitt Block House, Frick Building and many more during your visit.\n\n## Downtown\n\n### Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail Complex\n\nStunningly beautiful. Singularly graceful. A symphony of arches. Considered by many to be the leading architect of the 19th century, Henry Hobson Richardson's 19th century neo-medieval design combines stunning brickwork and crisp granite detail. An outdoor fountain in the courtyard park highlights the magnificent riverfront structure, while the Bridge of Sighs (mirroring the Venice original) --at one time used to transport prisoners--connects the Courthouse to the former jail. What Richardson considered his best work remains among elite architectural company in Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle.\n\n### BNY Mellon\n\nBorn out of a merger between The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation, The Bank of New York Mellon has a substantial Pittsburgh presence. It's the oldest banking corporation in the nation - tracing its roots back to Alexander Hamilton. BNY Mellon Center is 55 stories and was completed in 1983. It is the second-tallest building in the city, boasts an eight-sided design and a rooftop heliport. On a clear day it is possible to spot the building from as far as 50 miles away.\n\n### Fort Pitt Block House\n\nThe Block House is the oldest structure in the City of Pittsburgh and the last vestige of the British Empire, built here in 1764 by the English Army. Much of its original fabric is still intact and it is open and free to the public year-round as an historic landmark. The Block House is the focal point in Point State Park where the three rivers of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny, the Ohio and the Monongahela, meet.\n\n### Frick Building\n\nThe Frick Building (1901-02), the first of industrialist Henry Clay Frick's architectural ventures on Grant Street, Downtown. In 1903, Leslie's Weekly judged it \"the finest office building in the world,\" and no wonder: Daniel Burnham gave the coke and steel king a vertical version of the White City, a neo-classical tower with a dazzling white, T-shaped marble lobby, clean and crisp as a new dollar bill; bronze lions flanking the entrance; and John La Farge's stained glass window, \"Fortune and Her Wheel,\" above a marble bust of Frick installed after his death in 1919.\n\n### Fifth Avenue Place\n\nHome to Highmark, Pennsylvania's largest health insurer, Fifth Avenue Place was completed in 1988 and has 31 floors. The structure is made of a unique granite frame for roughly 450 feet and then collapses inward in a pyramid shape for another 124-foot-tall roof structure. Protruding from the top of the skyscraper is a 178-foot-tall mast. Despite its rounded appearance, the 13-story structure is actually 12-sided and measures four feet in diameter.\n\n### Gulf Tower\n\nRising 44 stories above the Downtown skyline, the Gulf Tower beacon glows different colors according to weather conditions. Built as the headquarters for the Gulf Oil Company, the structure was completed in 1932. The crown of the skyscraper is modeled after the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus in the style of the step pyramid. The building was listed as a Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark in 1973.\n\n### K&L Gates Center\n\nK&L Gates Center is one of the major distinctive and recognizable features of downtown Pittsburgh. The building, long known as One Oliver Plaza and briefly as FreeMarkets Center and Ariba Center, was completed in 1968, has 39 floors and rises 511 feet above downtown Pittsburgh.\n\n### Omni William Penn Hotel\n\nBuilt in 1916, this grand hotel boasts a history as one of the architectural centerpieces in downtown Pittsburgh. Unique features include the historic filigreed arches cradling the main lobby space, elegant lanterns that once again grace the sidewalk. Enlarged in 1929 by architect Benno Janssen and his partners, the hotel lobby has Old World elegance, with its potted palms, crystal chandeliers and classical music. The hotel's finest room, however, is on the 17th floor -- the Art Deco ballroom designed by New York architect Joseph Urban. The hotel is the last of four buildings in three adjacent blocks commissioned by industrialist Henry Clay Frick, who sometimes reserved the Presidential suite for his own use.\n\n### Oxford Centre\n\nOne Oxford Centre is actually a complex of six buildings, all of matching glass and steel design. Completed in 1983, One Oxford Centre has 46 floors in its main tower and rises 615 feet about Downtown. The tower has nearly 1.5 million square feet of office and high-end retail space. At night, 43 spotlights illuminate the Centre with a total of 55,000 watts that create a glowing effect said to be greater than any other high-rise in the U.S. The building is designed the way it is, with so many sides, because the developers wanted as many corner offices in it as possible.\n\n### PNC/Fairmont Tower\n\nHeadquartered in Pittsburgh, The PNC Financial Services Group is one of the nation's largest financial services companies. Three PNC/Fairmont is a 23-story skyscraper and is one of the nation's largest mixed-use LEED-certified green buildings. It's also the site of one of the largest \"living walls\" in North America. Included is the green 185-room Fairmont Pittsburgh Hotel, as well as 28 luxury condos. The company is at work on The Tower at PNC Plaza, which is expected to be the world's largest green high-rise.\n\n### PPG Place\n\nBeautiful PPG Place is the headquarters for PPG Industries, Inc. and perhaps the most distinctive building in Pittsburgh's picturesque skyline. PPG Place, a large building complex including a 40-story tower (635 feet) with five satellite buildings that cover a six city block area, was designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee. The large urban complex was in part inspired by two existing architectural landmarks in Pittsburgh, the Cathedral of Learning in the University of Pittsburgh's campus and H.H. Richardson's Allegheny County Courthouse.\n\nIn PPG Place, Johnson made loose use of Gothic architectural vocabulary, translating it into modern materials and construction techniques. PPG Place stands perhaps as one of Johnson's buildings that best demonstrate his wit and affinity for mixed messages. By mixing historical forms with modern methods of construction, Johnson created a post-modernist building which is truly unique, in part due to its use of materials, which were immensely appropriate since PPG is a leading manufacturer of curtain wall assemblies.\n\n### Union Trust Building\n\nFormerly known as the Union Arcade (1915-1917). The architect of this Flemish Gothic fantasy was Pittsburgher Frederick J. Osterling, who had enlarged Frick's Point Breeze home two decades earlier. It is Frick's answer to the then-new Woolworth Building in New York City, the world's tallest. When it opened, it was Pittsburgh's most sumptuous shopping mall, although its four floors of shops have been reduced to one. Step inside, walk to the center and look up into the delicate lace of the stained glass dome.\n\n### U.S. Steel Tower\n\nDesigned by Harrison & Abramovitz, the world headquarters of the U.S. Steel Corporation was completed in 1971. During the initial planning stages, the U.S. Steel Corporation seriously considered making this development the world's tallest building. The tower's shape, mirroring the shape of Downtown Pittsburgh, is a triangle with indented corners. It was the first building to use liquid-fireproofed columns. At the time of its completion this was the world's tallest building outside of New York and Chicago, and is still the tallest building in Pittsburgh at 64 stories. When its construction was completed in 1971, the building was considered to be an engineering masterpiece. The Tower is home to the global headquarters for both the U.S. Steel Corporation and UPMC, a leader in innovative health care practices and a health insurance provider.\n\n## Mt. Washington\n\n### Chatham Village\n\nBuilt in the early 1930s, Chatham Village is a model planned community with rowhouses, garden courts, greenbelt and recreation facilities opened through the Buhl Foundation to promote social reforms and housing improvements for middle-income families. This influenced the development of 20th century urban planning in the US.\n\n## Oakland\n\n### Cathedral of Learning\n\nThe Cathedral of Learning is the centerpiece of the University of Pittsburgh's main campus in Oakland. Standing at 535 feet, the 42-story Cathedral is the tallest educational building in the western hemisphere and the second tallest in the world. The Cathedral was commissioned in 1921 and finished in 1937, and has 2,529 windows.\n\n### Nationality Rooms\n\nThe first and third floors of the Cathedral of Learning are home to 29 Nationality Rooms. As gifts to the University of Pittsburgh from the city's ethnic communities, these 30 unique classrooms take you on a voyage of world cultures and global traditions. Witness designs that range from Byzantine and Classical to Renaissance and Romanesque. Step inside Beijing, Damascus, Athens and more to hear each room's unique story without having set foot outside Pittsburgh.\n\n## Authentic Experiences\n\n[iframe](https://c7d111ae6a728604daf22b8ce73917ec.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-45/html/container.html)\n\n[iframe](https://c7d111ae6a728604daf22b8ce73917ec.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-45/html/container.html)\n\n[iframe](https://c7d111ae6a728604daf22b8ce73917ec.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-45/html/container.html)", "source_category": "general_info", "source_root_url": "https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:08:27.115606", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 10517, "cleaned_content_length": 10517, "word_count": 1514, "char_count": 10517, "description": "Pittsburgh's skyline is full of architectural and cultural history.

More than 1,200 people slurped and shopped in the \"Soup Hop,\" which benefits a local food pantry.\n\nInstagram\n\n[![southsidesoup](https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/10784956_724013594355402_1140685834_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150_tt6&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InByb2ZpbGVfcGljLmRqYW5nby4xNTAuYzIifQ&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QGMvQs0VJ8JcWE1Z0ksYUYax3b55PmYFlt3FOYdCarphTCfVStjqAytp-LTVeZzygA&_nc_ohc=ji0i5aMF4rAQ7kNvwFEkmzD&_nc_gid=Q0W1CZ5EHW0uCqnK_Vfc2A&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_Afc13am4iqAocWQp5XwVomkxOY7Uak5fF3_7GjI_CHESCA&oe=68E7C92C&_nc_sid=10d13b)](https://www.instagram.com/southsidesoup/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7)\n\n[southsidesoup](https://www.instagram.com/southsidesoup/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7)\n\n[Cup Ka Joe](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/261929133/cup-ka-joe/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7)\n\n[View profile](https://www.instagram.com/southsidesoup/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7)\n\n[![Instagram post shared by @southsidesoup](https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/27878407_188770911720677_5730153321155526656_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_tt6&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QGMvQs0VJ8JcWE1Z0ksYUYax3b55PmYFlt3FOYdCarphTCfVStjqAytp-LTVeZzygA&_nc_ohc=tcxVWvds9mYQ7kNvwELOGD_&_nc_gid=Q0W1CZ5EHW0uCqnK_Vfc2A&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_Afd0JuVqysUxX7bYbptCG5yNS07f28FxWh0O91BeRRZpiA&oe=68E7D44C&_nc_sid=10d13b)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfTvLyBF4yX/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7)\n\n[![southsidesoup](https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-19/10784956_724013594355402_1140685834_a.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s150x150_tt6&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InByb2ZpbGVfcGljLmRqYW5nby4xNTAuYzIifQ&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QGMvQs0VJ8JcWE1Z0ksYUYax3b55PmYFlt3FOYdCarphTCfVStjqAytp-LTVeZzygA&_nc_ohc=ji0i5aMF4rAQ7kNvwFEkmzD&_nc_gid=Q0W1CZ5EHW0uCqnK_Vfc2A&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_Afc13am4iqAocWQp5XwVomkxOY7Uak5fF3_7GjI_CHESCA&oe=68E7C92C&_nc_sid=10d13b)\\\\\n\\\\\nsouthsidesoup\\\\\n\\\\\n81 posts · 566 followers\\\\\n\\\\\n\n[View more on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/southsidesoup/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7)\n\n[Like](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfTvLyBF4yX/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7) [_Comment_](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfTvLyBF4yX/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7) [_Share_](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfTvLyBF4yX/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7) [_Save_](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfTvLyBF4yX/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7)\n\n[14 likes](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfTvLyBF4yX/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7)\n\n[Add a comment...](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfTvLyBF4yX/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7) [_Instagram_](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfTvLyBF4yX/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9463ca7-80e1-401b-bc83-088faa87c9e7)\n\n## One Big Table: An International Feasting\n\n_Mar./Apr. 2026 (Dates TBA)_\n\n20+ restaurants showcase food from around the world to highlight Pittsburgh's diverse culinary scene and talented chefs with a food fair, entertainment, global marketplace and more.

The three rivers that meet in Pittsburgh are actually a vast watershed of more than a dozen unique creeks and river systems that include more than 30,000 miles of rivers and streams extending into New York and West Virginia. These clean and accessible waters have become a stunning icon of Pittsburgh's environmental transformation.\n\n## Kayaking, Paddling & Rowing\n\nPittsburgh's rivers are ideal for sculling, kayaking and canoeing. The [Three Rivers Water Trail System](http://www.friendsoftheriverfront.org/ \"Three Rivers Water Trail System\") is a project intended to develop the rivers as recreational waterways with convenient access points and day-use sites; the Allegheny River Trail is already complete. On the Allegheny River in the heart of [Downtown Pittsburgh](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/downtown-pittsburgh/), [Kayak Pittsburgh](https://ventureoutdoors.org/kayak-pittsburgh/ \"Kayak Pittsburgh\") rents solo and tandem kayaks, canoes, and hydrobikes for peaceful urban exploration. Located under the 31st Street Bridge on the [North Shore](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/north-shore-north-side/), the [Three Rivers Rowing Association](http://www.threeriversrowing.org/ \"Three Rivers Rowing Association\") offers rowing, kayaking, and dragon boating to individuals, schools and organizations of all skill levels. The [Steel City Rowing Club](http://www.steelcityrowing.org/ \"Steel City Rowing Club\") is the only rowing organization on the upper Allegheny River, which boasts nine full miles of rowing without locks or dams, on relatively undeveloped wetlands.\n\n## Boating\n\nPittsburgh has the second-largest number of registered pleasure boats in the country. There are [seventeen marinas](http://www.fish.state.pa.us/marinas.htm \"Seventeen Marinas\") in Allegheny County along the three rivers, offering river access, dining and boat maintenance. [Station Square](http://www.stationsquare.com/ \"Station Square\") in the [South Side](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/south-side/) offers public docks at Bessemer Court, for easy river access to downtown shopping and dining. Also within the city limits are four [public boat launches](http://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Portals/72/docs/Recreation/BOAT%20LAUNCHING%20RAMPS.pdf \"Public Boat Launches\"), one on the Monongahela River in the South Side and three along the Allegheny River Trail. Visitors can rent kayaks and boats at the North Park Boathouse through [Venture Outdoors](http://www.ventureoutdoors.org/).\n\n## Fishing\n\nThere are 38.3 miles of river shoreline within the city limits. [Venture Outdoors](http://www.ventureoutdoors.org/ \"Venture Outdoors\") organizes weekly lunchtime fishing in [Point State Park](http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/point/ \"link to Point State Park website\") or [North Shore Riverfront Park](http://www.pgh-sea.com/northshoreriverfrontpark.htm \"North Shore Riverfront Park\"), with an instructor on hand to help the novice and expert alike. Regionally, western Pennsylvania's [state parks](http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/ \"State Parks\") abound with well-stocked lakes and streams. Deer Lakes Park and North Park both have [accessible fishing piers](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Parks-and-Events/Activities/Fishing).\n\n## Whitewater\n\nIn [Ohiopyle State Park](http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/ \"Ohiopyle State Park\"), the Youghiogheny River boasts class III and IV rapids and is considered to be some of the best whitewater in the east. [White Water Adventurers](http://www.wwaraft.com/ \"White Water Adventurers\") and [Laurel Highlands River Tours](http://www.laurelhighlands.com/ \"Laurel Highlands River Tours\") organize rafting and kayaking for groups of all sizes and skill levels on the Youghiogheny River.\n\n## Water Resources\n\n[PA Fish + Boat Commission](http://www.fish.state.pa.us/ \"PA Fish and Boat Commission\") State agency responsible for the protection and management of Pennsylvania's aquatic resources. Issues fishing liscences and boat registrations.\n\n[Riverlife](http://www.riverlifepgh.org/ \"Link to River Life website\") Nonprofit organization bringing economic development, design, and recreation to the downtown riverfronts by working with property owners, public leaders and community groups.\n\n## Authentic Experiences", "source_category": "general_info", "source_root_url": "https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:08:27.147012", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 5369, "cleaned_content_length": 5369, "word_count": 576, "char_count": 5369, "description": "Explore the outdoors of Pittsburgh by taking a day to go fishing, going kayaking or canoeing, or going with a group on a whitewater rafting adventure."}}

You don't need to go to a museum to enjoy beautiful art!\n\nNo matter where you are in [Downtown Pittsburgh](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/downtown-pittsburgh/) or [Oakland](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/oakland/), you are steps away from experiencing a work of art. Self-guided walking tours of art in public spaces are available courtesy of the [Office of Public Art,](http://opapgh.org/ \"Office of Public Art\") in partnership with the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council and the City of Pittsburgh's Department of City Planning, in print or as [downloadable PDFs](http://opapgh.org/resources/publications/). The Office of Public Art also offers a comprehensive resource, [Pittsburgh Art Places](http://opapgh.org/resources/pittsburgh-art-places/), for finding public art and arts venues in the Greater Pittsburgh region.\n\n## Downtown Walking Tours\n\nThe Downtown tours winds through four neighborhoods, focusing on remarkable artwork by nationally and internationally recognized artists. Since many of these artists were inspired by the Pittsburgh region when they created their pieces, the tour is also a great way to learn about Pittsburgh's place in history. Downtown tours: 30-60 minutes each.\n\n[Get the Cultural District Walking Tour](http://opapgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OPA_ArtinPublicPlaces_CulturalDistrict.pdf \"Get the Downtown Walking Tour\")\n\n[Get the Grant Street Corridor Walking Tour](http://opapgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OPA_ArtinPublicPlaces_GrantStCorridor.pdf)\n\n[Get the Retail District and First Side Walking Tour](http://opapgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OPA_ArtinPublicPlaces_RetailFirstside.pdf)\n\n## North Shore and Northside Walking Tours\n\nJust across the Allegheny River from Downtown Pittsburgh are the North Shore and Northside neighborhoods. Explore the riverfront to view art, monuments, and memorials that honor the people, events and industries of the region. Or trek further into the Northside neighborhood to find contemporary art and monuments intermingled with historic buildings, parks, museums and the Mexican War Streets historic district. North Shore and Northside Tours: 60-120 minutes each.\n\n[Get the North Shore Walking Tour](http://opapgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OPA_ArtinPublicPlaces_NorthShore-1.pdf)\n\n[Get the Northside Walking Tour](http://opapgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/OPA_ArtinPublicPlaces_Northside.pdf)\n\n## Oakland Walking Tour\n\nPittsburgh's [Oakland](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/oakland/) neighborhood tour offers lovers of art and the outdoors photographs and descriptions of 35 works of public art in this historic neighborhood with architectural notes for select Oakland buildings. Created in partnership with [Carnegie Museum of Art](http://www.cmoa.org/ \"Carnegie Museum of Art\"). Oakland tour: 75-120 minutes.\n\n[Get the Oakland Walking Tour](http://opapgh.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Oakland_ONLINE06.pdf \"Get the Oakland Walking Tour\")\n\n## Cultural District Gallery Crawls\n\nArt. Music. Architecture. Film. Fun. FREE! The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Gallery Crawl is a free quarterly showcase of art and entertainment in the heart of the Downtown Cultural District. All events take place at a variety of galleries and eclectic spaces. Keep an eye out for the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership's Night Market, happening alongside the crawl, featuring local artists and food vendors.\n\n## Art Within Art\n\nIt is very rare for a Convention Center to promote its public art as [Art within Art](http://www.pittsburghcc.com/public-art/ \"Art within Art\") but the David L. Lawrence is a very rare meeting/exhibition venue. Home to more than 25 works of art, valued at $2 million, including seven commissioned pieces that reflect the vitality, character and creative energy of the Pittsburgh Region.\n\n## A River of Glass\n\nA river of glass now flows through Pittsburgh in the city's first all-glass public art installation. \"Rivers of Glass: Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue,\" located in the lobby of 11 Stanwix Street, an historic 1960s-era office tower in downtown Pittsburgh is now open for all to enjoy, weekdays, 9am-5pm. [The Pittsburgh Glass Center](http://www.pittsburghglasscenter.org/ \"The Pittsburgh Glass Center\") is one of the partners in this extraordinary work. [See photos of the installation.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pittsburghglasscenter/sets/72157617354324377/ \"See photos of the installation\")\n\n## MLK Community Mural Project\n\nThe [MLK Community Mural Project](http://www.mlkmural.com/ \"MLK Community Mural Project\") is the biggest and brightest art venture in the city's history, with murals scheduled to cover 26 walls throughout the city and already engaging hundreds of Pittsburgh's biggest and brightest residents. Currently, the project has produced more than a dozen murals along the MLK East Busway, spanning eight neighborhoods.\n\n## Authentic Experiences", "source_category": "general_info", "source_root_url": "https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:08:27.156224", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 5950, "cleaned_content_length": 5950, "word_count": 664, "char_count": 5950, "description": "Explore Pittsburgh's public art with one of our walking tour itineraries.

A city built on innovation, Pittsburgh continues to push the envelope with major contributions in technology, education, medicine and beyond. In fact, in 2021, WalletHub named Greater Pittsburgh its sixth-best metro area for STEM professionals.\n\nBut, more than Pittsburgh’s industries have changed – the skyline has been completely transformed, too! Riverfronts are thoughtfully developed, utilized for recreation now more than ever. Businesses look to the environment as an asset, not a challenge. And, best of all, \"green\" has replaced \"smoky\" for good.\n\nPittsburgh is a vibrant, mid-sized city that has the feel of a small town. Its approachability can be seen on the faces of its energetic, hard-working and proud people.\n\n## A City in Transformation\n\nBike, walk or rollerblade miles of riverfront trails and soak in fantastic urban views. Wrapped in rivers, intertwined with trails and packed with parks, it is a green and outdoor city in close contact with its surrounding countryside. Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens opened its Center for Sustainable Landscapes, one of the world's first certified living buildings, a model of sustainability for architects, scientists, planners and anyone interested in living greener.\n\nIn the eyes of many of its visitors, Pittsburgh offers a surprising and unexpected experience, with natural beauty, unique terrain and diverse offerings at every turn. Pittsburgh's [history](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/things-to-do/arts-culture/history/) and blue-collar image makes the city and its inhabitants approachable and unpretentious.\n\nTake to the streets of Pittsburgh and explore this vibrant city. There are free, self-guided and guided [architectural](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/things-to-do/arts-culture/architecture/) and public art walking tours are offered in many of the city's unique 90 [neighborhoods](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/).\n\nMake the time to travel to Beyond Pittsburgh, too, where you will find everything from whitewater rafting to sailing to country festivals to hiking and more just a short drive outside of Downtown Pittsburgh. Enjoy the slower pace and beautiful landscape of the countryside.\n\n## In This Section\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271%27%20height%3D%271%27%20style%3D%27background%3Atransparent%27%2F%3E)\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\nIndexPGH \\\\\n\\\\\nLearn More](https://www.indexpgh.com/)", "source_category": "general_info", "source_root_url": "https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:08:27.160909", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 4231, "cleaned_content_length": 4231, "word_count": 401, "char_count": 4231, "description": "As America's Most Livable City, Pittsburgh is rich with history and culture.
