Credit Program is a Pennsylvania tax credit for businesses who make a donation to an approved nonprofit organization.  The Frick Art Pittsburgh, a valuable source of innovative learning and inspiration, is an approved Educational Improvement Organization.\n\nCompanies making a contribution to the Frick through EITC can receive significant tax benefits.  Approved corporations can receive tax credits equal to 75 percent of its contribution up to a maximum of $750,000 per taxable year.  Businesses who agree to provide the same amount for two consecutive tax years can receive 90% of the contribution as a tax credit.  This can mean you receive up to 90% of your gift total as a tax credit: your $10,000 gift could result in a credit as high as $9,000.\n\nContact Manager of Insitutional Support Jodi Golomb for details at 412-342-4089 or [JGolomb@TheFrickPittsburgh.org](mailto:JGolomb@thefrickpittsburgh.org).\n\n## EITC in 3 Easy Steps\n\n#### [Step 1\\  Determine if you

Tax\n- Shareholder and Partner personal income tax (S Corps and Partnerships with pass-through tax liability)\n\n#### [Step 2\\

[here.](http://dced.pa.gov/programs/educational-improvement-tax-credit-program-eitc)\n\n#### [Step 3\\  Make the Frick the recipient of your EITC-eligible contribution](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/eitc\\#acc1-tab3)\n\nOnce your application has been approved by the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED), your business must contribute to a qualified organization, such as the Frick, within 60 days.  You need to send proof of the contribution to DCED within 90 days of the approval.  The Frick will send you an acknowledgement letter as proof of your contribution, and you are required to send a copy of this letter to DCED.\n\n## Your support impacts thousands of students\n\nIn addition to receiving tax benefits, your EITC gift supports impacts thousands of students by helping to underwrite various types of programs and visits by school groups throughout the region.  The Frick’s meaningful and standards-based education programs enhance the experiences of children and underserved students.  Using interactive activities and adaptive lessons, we engaged students in a meaningful way with our interdisciplinary collections.\n\n[Learn more about education at the Frick >>](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/learn)\n\nIn recognition of your support, the Frick will list your organization name

Often referred to as \"IRA Charitable Rollover Gifts,\" these gifts are distributions paid directly from an IRA to a nonprofit.\n\nIf you are 70½ or older, you can transfer as much as $100,000 per year from an IRA directly to the Frick—without counting this transfer as taxable income.\n\nIf you were 70½ before January 1, 2020, the qualified charitable distribution counts toward your required minimum distribution (RMD). If you are 70½ after January 1, 2020, you do not have required minimum distribution until age 72. If you do not meet your RMDs, IRA owners face a large tax penalty. This means you would either withdraw those amounts (increasing your taxable income) or donate them as a qualified charitable distribution.\n\nThe most common way to make this gift is to submit a request to your IRA custodian. For more information on Qualified Charitable Distributions to the Frick, contact: Advancement & Engagement staff at 412-342-4086 or [Membership@TheFrickPittsburgh.org](mailto:Membership@TheFrickPittsburgh.org).\n\n[![The Frick Pittsburgh Museums and Gardens Logo](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Files/User/logo.svg)](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/ \"The Frick Pittsburgh Museums and Gardens Logo\")\n\nKeep up to date with news and events from The Frick Pittsburgh newsletter.\n\n#### The Frick Pittsburgh\n\n7227 Reynolds St.\n\nPittsburgh, PA 15208\n\n**Hours:**\n\nMonday: Closed\n\nTuesday-Sunday: Gardens and grounds open 8 AM-8PM\n\n_[View detailed hours](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/plan-your-visit#visit)_ [412-371-0600](tel:4123710600) [info@thefrickpittsburgh.org](mailto:info@thefrickpittsburgh.org)\n\n#### Contact\n\n- [Media Inquiries](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/mediainquiries)\n- [Employment](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/employment)\n- [Rentals](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/rentals)\n- [Partnership Programs](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/programmatic-collaborations)\n- [Membership](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/membership)\n\n#### About\n\n- [Our Mission](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/mission)\n- [Annual Report &\\\\\n\\\\\nStrategic Plan](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/strategicplan)\n- [Board of Trustees](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/boardoftrustees)\n- [Trustee Portal](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/board-portal)\n- [Member Portal](https://tickets.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Login.aspx)\n\n- [Leadership](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/leadership)\n- [Accessibility](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/accessibility)\n- [Inclusion](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/inclusion)\n- [Land Acknowledgement](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/landacknowledgement)\n- [Press Releases](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/pressreleases)\n- [Photo Policy](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/photography-policy)\n\nTrustee Login\n\n#### The Frick legacy\n\n- [The Frick Family](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/familyandlegacy)\n- [Historic Home & Gardens](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/historichome)\n\n[![](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Files/Admin/RAD%2Dsmall%2D%281%29.png)](https://www.radworkshere.org/)\n\n[![](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Files/Admin/Condensed-Logo-Full-Color.png?d=2024716142433)](http://www.visitpa.com/)\n\nCopyright 2018 \\| The Frick Pittsburgh \\| [Website by Blue Archer](http://www.bluearcher.com/)", "source_category": "music_culture", "source_root_url": "https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:25:22.310673", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 3599, "cleaned_content_length": 3599, "word_count": 338, "char_count": 3599, "description": "Make an impact with The Frick Pittsburgh.", "event_date": "January 1, 2020"}}

That foresight has enabled The Frick Pittsburgh to evolve into the unique museum we have today.\n\nYou, too, can create a legacy that will help ensure that the Frick continues to serve students and families well into the future. In addition to making a difference in the lives of others, a planned gift can provide tax savings or income benefits for you and your family. There are many ways to make such a gift—simple methods include gifts in your will or living trust, gifts of life insurance, gifts of retirement assets, and more.\n\nTo make the process of legacy giving easy, The Frick has partnered with FreeWill for our community to create an estate plan for free. **[FreeWill’s secure online tool empowers you to write a legally valid will or trust in about 20 minutes.](http://www.freewill.com/thefrickpittsburgh?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=202206_thefrickpittsburgh_plannedgivingpg)** As you write your will, FreeWill presents you with the opportunity to make a planned gift to The Frick on your terms.\n\nIf you have ‘non-probate’ assets like a life insurance policy that you’d like to donate, you can **[use this FreeWill tool to log all of these assets and name The Frick as a beneficiary.](http://www.freewill.com/beneficiaries/thefrickpittsburgh?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=202206_thefrickpittsburgh_plannedgivingpg)**\n\nIf you have already created a legacy by including a gift in your estate plan, **[will you please complete this form to let us know?](http://www.freewill.com/record/thefrickpittsburgh?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=202206_thefrickpittsburgh_plannedgivingpg)** This helps us update our records and thank you for building a legacy to support The Frick’s authentic experiences with art, history, and nature.\n\n### Dr. Soumyo Moitra's Story\n\nDr. Moitra understands the impact that art, history, and nature can have on someone. As a graduate student, Moitra appreciated the ability to come and visit the The Frick Art Museum for free when he didn’t have many resources. “I think it’s so important to have this opportunity, especially if you’re interested in art but can’t afford to pay the price of admission,” Moitra says.\n\nAs an adult, Moitra retained his love of art and was compelled to join the Frick as a member, remembering the effect the museums had on him in his younger years. Thinking about his own legacy, he also decided to make a planned gift to the Frick, knowing that his gift would make it possible for future generations of students to visit, as he had.\n\nThe Frick has been a key part of Dr. Moitra’s life for many years, and he feels it is important to give back, support the future of the institution, and ensure that anyone can find sanctuary on our campus. We are so thankful for members like Dr. Moitra, who have a positive impact on everything we do here.\n\n## Legacy Planning\n\n#### [Gifts in Your Will\\  Many supporters of The Frick Pittsburgh choose to leave a donation in their wills and trusts.](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/legacyplanning\\#acc1-tab1)\n\nMany supporters of The Frick Pittsburgh choose to leave a donation in their wills and trusts to increase their long-term impact, without any upfront cost during their lifetimes\n\nA gift in your will is often the simplest route to your legacy, and to make it as easy as possible, we're giving you a completely free way to write or start your will. **[Click here](http://www.freewill.com/thefrickpittsburgh?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=202206_thefrickpittsburgh_plannedgivingpg) to start the completely free process of writing your legal will.** Including a gift to The Frick Pittsburgh helps to cultivate a community where we share authentic connections with art, history, nature—and with one another.\n\nThis tool is free to you whether you choose to include a gift to The Frick Pittsburgh or not.

Read                                         Landscape with River (1880/1880) by George Hetzel **The Frick Pittsburgh**                                George Hetzel was one of the most popular and well-known painters to work in the Pittsburgh region in the late 19th century. This painting, bought in 1881, is the earliest recorded purchase of a work of art by Henry Clay Frick.                Hetzel's intimate and meditative views of nature are characteristic of works by the Scalp Level School, a group of Pittsburgh-based artists who gathered annually at a mountain retreat near Johnstown, Pennsylvania to sketch and paint the surrounding wilderness.                                                Banks of the Seine at Lavacourt (Bords de la Seine a Lavacourt) (1879/1879) by Claude Monet **The Frick Pittsburgh**                                This painting, which hangs in the sitting room at Clayton, illustrates typical qualities of an Impressionist work:                active, visible brushstrokes, an interest in capturing light effects, and a much brighter palette than was typical of Salon painting at the time.                                                        Still Life (1890/1890) by William Michael Harnett **The Frick Pittsburgh**                                Probably the finest American painting at Clayton, this modest trompe l’oeil still life measures less than eight by ten inches. The French expression trompe l’oeil means to “fool the eye” and it is used to describe a style of extreme illusionism in painting.                Harnett, made a name for himself as the quintessential American trompe l’oeil painter. It is said that when his paintings were publicly exhibited, guards were required to prevent onlookers from trying to remove objects from the painting.                                                Still Life with Fruit (1769/1769) by Jan van Os **The Frick Pittsburgh**                                This richly detailed composition is a fine example of Netherlandish still-life painting.     Purchased by Henry Clay Frick in 1896, it marks Frick’s first venture into collecting old masters.                The assortment of spring flowers and late summer fruit depicted could never have existed as seen here. Van Os created imaginary arrangements based on watercolor studies he made of each specimen in season.                In this painting, even the smallest objects—insects, snails, and water droplets—are perfectly delineated.                                                The Virgin of Humility Crowned by Two Angels (early 1440s) by Stefano di Giovanni called Sassetta **The Frick Pittsburgh**                                One of the most important figures of Sienese painting, Sassetta combined the stylized figures and rich ornamentation of the Gothic style with the naturalism of the budding Florentine Renaissance.                For example, while surrounded by a field of heavenly gold, the elegant, sinuous Madonna sits on a cushion placed on a tile floor rendered in perspective to create a sense of space.                The faces and gestures of the Madonna and child also portray a more natural solemn tenderness.                                                Nativity (c. 1426-1440) by Giovanni di Paolo **The Frick Pittsburgh**                                Giovanni di Paolo was a master of the Sienese tradition of decorative and precious painting. While many of his Renaissance contemporaries favored a more realistic rendering of spatial relationships, employing accurate linear perspective, he opted for a curving, narrative composition, loaded with religious symbols.                Giovanni's training as a miniaturist is reflected in exquisite details, like the fruit trees, and the meticulously painted peacock.                                                Madonna and Child with St. Elizabeth and St. John (1523/1530) by Bacchiacca **The Frick Pittsburgh**                                The use of vibrant, saturated colors in this composition clearly indicate that Bacchiacca was aware of the development of Mannerism, a late-Renaissance style characterized by a move away from realism towards stylish and artful exaggeration.                The Florentine artist is cleverly quoting from paintings by the most important artists of the time--the head of the Madonna is very similar to those of Leonardo da Vinci, and Saint Elizabeth is modeled after a figure by Andrea del Sarto.                                                Rest on the Flight into Egypt (c. 1509-1520) by Unknown **The Frick Pittsburgh**                                This tapestry is a rare example of an intact devotional weaving, used as a mobile altar. It is composed very much like a painting, with a naturalistic landscape and figures framed by a decorative border.                It is of exceptional qualilty, made with the finest materials—including gold and silver threads. The cost of materials and the months of labor required made tapestries more expensive than paintings and a status symbol demanded by kings and popes.                The composition is filled with meticulous, naturalistic details—botanically correct rendering of foliage, and irises, a diving duck, frog, and heron.                                                The Blessing (Le Bénédicité) (early 1600s) by Antoine Le Nain **The Frick Pittsburgh**                                Although executed in miniature, the figures in Antoine Le Nain’s Le Bénédicité, are full of life, their faces are individually characterized, expressive with a range of feeling.                The direct gaze and wonderful smile of the boy on the right imbues the whole composition with a feeling of affection and immediacy.    With his toothy grin, he is one of the most memorable and carefully rendered figures associated with this artist, whose figures were normally more subdued.                                                Pastorale: A Peasant Boy Fishing (1732/1732) by François Boucher **The Frick Pittsburgh**                                Boucher was a young man at the start of an illustrious career when he painted this pastoral—a romanticized vision of country life, in which a peasant couple, full of the bloom of youth, relax and flirt in an idealized landscape.                The painting fully reveals all the freshness of Boucher's brushwork, his mastery of textures, whether it be in the straws of the basket, the foliage of the trees, the softness of the fabric, or the airy matter of the clouds.

We thank you for your continued support and hope to answer some of your questions below.\n\n**Why did you change the Café? Wasn’t it already perfect?**\n\nThe atmosphere is magical, and we are committed to keeping it so. But certain aspects of the Café’s pre-COVID business model didn't serve all of our visitors as well as they should. The adjustments we've made address some specific challenges:\n\nIn the past, the Café served a small number of people very well, but the great majority of our visitors not at all. During our busiest months, from April to December, the Café was fully booked at lunchtime days in advance. We routinely turned away two, three, and even four times as many people as we could seat. Without an opportunity for rest and refreshment, many visitors left the Frick before they could experience all we have to offer.\n\nBy expanding our open hours, we hope to increase the number of visitors we can serve. From quick-and-easy delights to special-occasion indulgences, we are aiming to meet the needs of as many of our visitors as possible.\n\n###### Hours\n\n**Tuesday–Sunday**\n\n**9:30 AM–3 PM**\n\nReservations not accepted\n\nThe Café is wheelchair-accessible and has single-stall all-gender restrooms.\n\n**We're hiring!** Learn more [here](https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/employment).\n\n#### Café Gift Cards\n\nShare the joy of a trip to The Café at the Frick with our gift cards!
