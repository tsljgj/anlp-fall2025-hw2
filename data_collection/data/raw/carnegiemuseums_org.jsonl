Since these great mammals left the land and took to the seas millions of years ago, their survival has been\n\ndependent on the evolution of ear structures that are highly specialized\n\nfor underwater hearing. The dark abyss of the ocean limits eyesight, and\n\nwater dilutes scent. But sound travels faster and covers greater distances\n\nin water than it does in air. So whales must rely primarily on sound for\n\nsensory perception, as well as for communication. Sound, therefore, has\n\na profound influence on navigation, feeding, socialization, breeding and\n\nother whale behavior.\n\nExtant whales, or cetaceans, fall into two groupstoothed whales, or\n\nodontocetes, and baleen whales, or mysticetes. Toothed whales are fast\n\nswimmers and hunters, and include porpoises, dolphins, killer whales and\n\nsperm whales. Baleen whales are filter-feeders that live on zooplanktons\n\nand include the blue whale, the humpback whale, the Gray whale and the\n\nbowhead whale.\n\nAmong the many differences between toothed and baleen whales is their\n\nspecialization for underwater hearing.\n\nLong before humans began using sonar for navigation, toothed whales\n\nwere using this method to “see” their environment. Also known as echolocation,\n\nthe toothed whale’s biological sonar involves vocalization from the nose,\n\nand the reception of the echo in the ear. The whale recycles the air in\n\nits complex nasal passage, and produces a high-pitched sound that is beamed\n\nout to the environment through the melon, an oil body in its bulging forehead.\n\nThe sound beamed from the melon into the environment is bounced back to\n\nthe whale, providing information that helps the animal to accurately decipher\n\nits environment.\n\nThe high-pitched, or ultra-sonic, sound emitted by the whale offers\n\na finer resolution for the echolocation and results in a more accurate\n\nperception of its environment. For the ultra-sonic sound to serve toothed\n\nwhales, their ears developed many structures specialized for hearing high-pitched\n\nsounds.\n\nBy contrast, the baleen whale can vocalize and hear very low-pitched,\n\nor infrasonic sound, which can travel great distances and scatter to large\n\nareas in water. With infrasonic sound, baleen whales can communicate with\n\neach other over geographic areas as large as an ocean basin.\n\nThese whales are famous for their rich repertoire of songs. The eerie\n\nmelodies are an integral part of the social fabric of baleen whales, allowing\n\nthe groups to stay in contact with each other over vast expanses of ocean.\n\nHow did toothed and baleen whales evolve these entirely different hearing\n\nadaptations? The extensive fossil record of extinct whales could have the\n\nanswer to this intriguing question.\n\nThe ear bones of all whales are extremely hard and dense, and they are\n\ncommon in whale fossils found in marine sediments. The internal bony structures\n\nrelated to hearing functions are well protected by the dense and hard ear\n\nbones, and are often preserved in exquisite condition. The fossilized bony\n\near structures can provide evidence for the underwater hearing in the extinct\n\nwhales and offer a window for paleontologists to look into the evolutionary\n\nhistory of whales’ ears. The knowledge about the evolutionary origins of\n\ntheir remarkable hearing adaptations would enrich our understanding of\n\nwhy sound is so crucial for the whale’s navigation, feeding and social\n\nbehavior.\n\nComputer Graphics Aid Research in Whale Evolution\n\nThe advent of new technology, such as CT-scanning and computer graphics,\n\nhas opened up new possibilities to study the ears of fossil whales. The\n\ninternal structures of the ear bones can be revealed by CT-scanning (computerized\n\ntomography, or x-ray) or by physical sectioning, which involves cutting\n\nthe fossil for study. The anatomical features observed by scanning or sectioning\n\ncan be converted to computer graphics. By way of computer graphics, the\n\nvital statistics of some of the ear structures can be more easily established.\n\nOnce we have more accurate information on some of their bony structures,\n\nsuch as size and proportion, we can estimate the range of hearing for the\n\nextinct whales.\n\nUsing these techniques, my research collaborators and I are able to\n\nshow that the earliest fossil toothed whales (present 28 million years\n\nago in Late Oligocene but extinct by the Late Miocene 13 million years\n\nlater) already had some bony structures for hearing high-pitched sound.\n\nThis discovery showed that whales were capable of echolocation, as least\n\nto some extent. Yet the degree of development of the specialized structure\n\nin early and archaic toothed whales was far less advanced than in the modern\n\nfamilies of toothed whales that originated in the Miocene and are still\n\naround today. This suggests that, although echolocation may have originated\n\nwith the early toothed whales, it was not nearly as advanced or sophisticated\n\nas it is in modern toothed whales. The extremely sensitive sonar of modern\n\nwhales most likely developed when the radiation, or spreading, of the modern\n\nfamilies of toothed whales occurred in the Miocene.\n\nOn the other hand, the early fossil baleen whales have retained the\n\nprimitive ear structures of their distant and archaic relatives. It is\n\npossible that the baleen whale’s capacity for hearing infrasonic sound\n\nis inherited from archaic whales or hoofed mammals.\n\nIn light of what we have learned from the ear structures of fossil whales\n\nthus far, it is likely that the divergence of ultrasonic echolocation of\n\ntoothed whales and the infrasonic hearing and communication of baleen whales\n\noccurred after the toothed and baleen whales split from each other in their\n\nevolution.\n\nAlthough this research is still in progress, we already have learned\n\nsome interesting things about how ancient whales heard. With the ongoing\n\naccumulation of more scientific information from fossil whales, we will\n\nget a better picture of the evolution that has given rise to the spectacular\n\nand intriguing hearing abilities of modern whales.\n\nZhexi Luo is assistant curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at Carnegie\n\nMuseum of Natural History.", "source_category": "music_culture", "source_root_url": "https://carnegiemuseums.org/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:23:34.096530", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 6552, "cleaned_content_length": 6552, "word_count": 975, "char_count": 6552, "description": ""}}

His eyes widened when he came across a layered scene of Africa. This was the one. His mother loved Africa, so the boy whipped out his library card and checked out the cardboard collage to surprise her with a three-week gift of fine art.\n\nLibrary patrons browse the Art Lending Collection on opening day.\n\nPhoto: Renee Rosensteel\n\nThere was just one problem. The framed artwork was too heavy for him to carry up the hill to his house in North Braddock. So he called his teenage sister, and together the two hauled it home.\n\nThe young boy’s discovery was one of many poignant moments in the first days of the library’s Art Lending Collection, which opened October 6 as part of Carnegie Museum of Art’s 2013 Carnegie International. “It was a moment of connection for this young person, getting excited about the art and extending it to his mother,” says Dana Bishop-Root, who together with Ruthie Stringer and Leslie Stem is at the helm of the massive lending project. “It had never occurred to me to check out a piece of art as a gift.”\n\nCollectively the trio is known as Transformazium, a North Braddock-based artist group that created and operates the collection in partnership with the Braddock Carnegie Library Association with support from The Heinz Endowments, The Pittsburgh Foundation, The Sprout Fund, and various individuals. While museum-goers flock to the Museum of Art to soak in the work of some of the world’s most celebrated contemporary artists inside pristine galleries, the lending collection democratizes the process by sending works by the same artists into homes of all sizes and income levels.\n\nAnyone with an Allegheny County library card can check out one of the nearly 100 artworks—including paintings, etchings, screen prints, photographs, poster reproductions, and even a large metal stencil—for up to three weeks, with one renewal provided there’s no waiting list. The late fees for art are the same as for a DVD: $1 a day.\n\nAlmost all of the 35 artists from 19 countries participating in this year’s International have donated work to the lending collection, which will have a life well beyond the run of the exhibition as a permanent part of the library. “It serves as a mirror to the International,” Bishop-Root says. “It is a different way to look at the artists’ work.”\n\nAmong those works by International artists available to borrow: an etched portrait by Carnegie Prize winner Nicole Eisenman; a threedimensional collage made from photographs, wood, and paint by San Francisco sculptor Vincent Fecteau; an ink and watercolor drawing by Iranian painter and animator Rokni Haerizadeh; and a small, spray-painted abstract painting made in 2012 by Sadie Benning.\n\nPhoto: Renee Rosensteel\n\nThe very first artwork to be checked out was a painting by British sculptor Phyllida Barlow, who for the International created the towering, nest-like concrete, wood, and mesh sculpture that appears to be growing out of the front entrance of the Oakland museum. For the art lending library, she donated a small, black-and-yellow watercolor of an old-fashioned movie projector dubbed Untitled: Defunct Projector, 12, part of a series she made as an homage to Swiss artist Dieter Roth.\n\nOther well-known names that are not part of the International but have inspired Transformazium’s practice also donated works, including multimedia artists Cory Arcangel and Nancy Brooks Brody. Three local art insiders—collector and former gallerist Ray Henderson, writer and critic Regis Welsh, and artist Jim Kidd, all of whom live in the Braddock Library service area—also donated works by various artists from their own collections.\n\nOne-of-a-kind works by Pittsburgh-based artists are also among those circulating from home to home. Alisha Wormsley, a multimedia artist, photographer, and teaching artist working in Pittsburgh, donated a white window frame with the phrase “There are Black People in the Future” spray painted onto its glass.\n\nA handful of the artwork, selected each month by library patrons, rotates in a small but prominent display at the Museum of Art to help spread the word about the project.\n\nTransformazium, after studying other art lending libraries, put an arbitrary value of $100 on each work. “We don’t want anyone to leave here and be responsible for anything valued at $15,000,” Bishop-Root says. In fact, she had to reassure jittery visitors that it was fine to take home the artwork, which travels in protective bags fashioned from moving blankets. In the first week, library patrons borrowed or put on hold 40 works.\n\nLindsey Scherloum, an artist who lives in North Braddock, was immediately drawn to a metal-onmetal work by New York artist Chris Stain, titled When You Walk Through the Storm. It features a man in working clothes and boots in the foreground and a house in the midst of a storm in the background. “It’s very striking,” Scherloum says. “It’s in line with what I’m doing now. I thought it would be a nice inspiration.”\n\nIndeed, Scherloum hung Stain’s work on a wood-paneled wall in her living room studio. “I designated it the wall where random pieces will come and go,” she says. “I feel very lucky that great art is accessible.”\n\nPatrons can learn about the art from three part-time facilitators, all of whom are residents of Braddock. Mary Carey is thrilled by how her new job has expanded her world. “I used to think art was just a picture, just a paintbrush and paint,” she says. “It seems like artists put so many secrets and stories in art.”\n\nShe’s particularly gratified when she tells a borrower a story about a painting and then later overhears them telling the same narrative to a friend they bring back to the library. “It’s a chain reaction,” she says.\n\nThis fact was not lost on Curt Roemele, a 76-year-old retired maintenance carpenter from Edgewood who recently borrowed Ebony 7, a painting of three women in African dress. He hung it on the mantel of his living room. “I think this is a great opportunity to have nice stuff in your house without spending a lot of money,” he says. “It’s a great act of trust to let people take things like this out.”\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nWhat’s Your Energy IQ?  ·  A Playful, Soulful Spectacle  ·  Energy in Human Form  ·  For the Love of Bugs  ·  Directors’ Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Face Time: Donald Warhola  ·  Artistic License: Girl Power  ·  Field Trip: Pop goes China  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

When an intriguing topic comes to mind or is tossed around in a meeting, she jots it down. “Art on the Brain, Memory and Perception” and “Totipotency, Plants and Poetics” are two among many. From this sea of paper accumulating to the right of her computer screen, the change agent is mapping ideas—waiting, she says, for a pattern to show itself.\n\nErin Peters and Edith Doron are charged with helping Carnegie Museums take interdisciplinary thinking to a new level.\n\nPhoto: Jim Judkis\n\n“I have to be all over the place right now, I think I’ll listen better that way,” says Doron, senior program manager for nexus projects, a two-year fellowship awarded to Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh through the prestigious American Council of Learned Societies Public Fellows Program.\n\nIn this new strategic role, Doron, who holds bachelor’s degrees in biology and comparative literature and a doctorate in modern thought and museum studies, is charged with discovering new ways of integrating the arts and science disciplines that define Carnegie Museums. Her challenge: foster a new level of interdisciplinary thinking across the four museums to better leverage assets and provide even more meaningful experiences for audiences.\n\n“We are uniquely situated to show our audiences how the arts and sciences speak to today’s issues, and how they speak to each other.”\n\n– Jo Ellen Parker, Carnegie Museums President\n\nIn the short term, this means developing new cross-disciplinary ventures—two to be driven by Doron, and a third to be cultivated as part of a new and robust partnership with the University of Pittsburgh. In the long run, it means changing the way the museums do business.\n\n“Aside from the Smithsonian, few other organizations enjoy the range of disciplines, collections, and expertise that our four Carnegie Museums represent,” says Carnegie Museums President and CEO Jo Ellen Parker. “Together, we engage audiences of all ages and broad interests. We need to capitalize on these strategic assets. We are uniquely situated to show our audiences how the arts and sciences speak to today’s issues, and how they speak to each other.”\n\nDoron, who has spent much of her career building collaborations in children’s museums, acknowledges that she arrived at the museums to find many irons already in the fire. “The question is, how do we do this work better internally and then really make it matter for the visitor?” asks the longtime New Yorker who lived in Scotland for a decade before moving to Pittsburgh this past August. Hers is one of three new positions Parker defines as “catalysts.”\n\nShe joins Cecile Shellman, who for the past year has been working to further advance Carnegie Museums’ commitment to diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (and was profiled in the summer 2015 magazine); and Erin Peters, who arrived in late August to a first-of-its-kind, four-year joint position between Carnegie Museums and Pitt.\n\nPeters’ role as assistant curator of science and research and curatorial studies lecturer, respectively, is part of a $1 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to Pitt’s department of history of art and architecture. Anchoring what Pitt has coined the Pittsburgh Constellation Consortium, the funding is designed to spur collaborative research and public engagement among the city’s rich collections of art and artifacts, starting with Carnegie Museums.\n\nFor Peters, who specializes in Roman Egypt and recently received her doctorate in art history from the University of Iowa, the challenge is to think more broadly about how Pitt’s art history program and the museums can work together to achieve mutually beneficial goals. “The humanities and museums are both moving in new and really exciting directions,” says Peters.“Thinking about their futures together, bringing people together and talking about ideas—not necessarily knowing they have some of the same ideas—and building on that, can be really powerful.”\n\nIt’s a natural fit for the longtime Oakland neighbors, says Barbara McCloskey, chair of Pitt’s department of history of art and architecture. “This partnership is a congruence of both interests,” she says. “There are really vast opportunities, and that’s what we’re going after, the untapped potential.”\n\nCarnegie Museums is interested in working across its collections—22 million scientific specimens and 40,000 art objects strong— to build tomorrow’s audiences. Pitt wants its museum studies students to have a practical leg up in navigating the changing landscape of the museum world, and Carnegie Museums, McCloskey says, is the ideal place to learn.\n\n“As the museums know, making collections more accessible is how you bring the public into your institutions and also how you generate new knowledge,” says McCloskey. “The museums have extraordinary collections, and we’ve got students who are ready, able, and willing to pursue research.”\n\nThose same students, guided by Peters, can also help the museums see their future through the fresh eyes of the next generation of museum visitors and supporters. Starting in the spring, Peters will teach an introduction to museums course at Pitt, using the four Carnegie Museums as a living laboratory. She’ll also supervise a small team of student interns working across the museums.\n\n“Because Carnegie Museums includes four distinct museums with different holdings and ways of operating, it’s the perfect model,” says Peters. “We’ll explore what is typically an art museum and how does Carnegie Museum of Art navigate that; and what is typically a natural history museum and how does Carnegie Museum of Natural History navigate that, and so on. How do we work together in this sort of older model of classification and separation and move beyond it to connection?”\n\nConsider, for example, Egyptian art and artifacts. Even though the objects are from the same location and same time period, notes Peters, Carnegie Museums houses the ancient treasures in two different museums—which share a building—and they’re displayed in completely different ways.\n\n“We’ll talk about what this tells us about museums and how they communicate messages,” says Peters. “How display lighting, what museums call objects, and how much information you put around objects creates an idea of what those objects are.”\n\nIt’s likely the students will even help the museum prototype elements of exhibitions, bringing the visitor into the process from the start, says Peters.\n\nAs these kinds of relationships continue to build—among the museums and between the museums and other organizations, such as Pitt—it’s all about changing the conversation, Parker says. “These catalyst positions haven’t been created so much to do something for us as to influence and shape the way we do most things we do.”\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nThe Elevation of Everyday Design  ·  Taking its Bow  ·  Art of the Now  ·  Inside the Cloud Factory  ·  President’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Artistic License: In Full Light  ·  Travel Log  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

The kids shriek and wave their arms wildly. “Encore, encore,” one boy yells. As if on cue, Hennessy shoots two more toy birds out of an air compressor, and the laughter inside Bayer Science Stage at Carnegie Science Center crescendos into a giddy frenzy.\n\nPhoto: Jim Judkis\n\nMaking kids laugh isn’t the only reason Hennessy propels stuffed animals, although that’s certainly a perk of his job as program developer at the Science Center. More importantly, he’s helping curious minds grasp and enjoy science, in this case by illustrating a scientific principle key to the Wright Brothers’ pioneering aircraft.\n\nBack in 1903, Hennessy tells the crowd, the Wright Brothers had a problem. Their early planes crashed to the ground. Then one of the brothers noticed a turkey vulture, in preparing to take flight, adjust its feathers. That observation gave the famous duo the brilliant idea to build an airplane with adjustable wings, which helped keep it aloft.\n\n“If you’re looking to make something bigger, faster, or stronger, chances are you’ll find the answer in nature,” says Hennessy.\n\nThat’s the take-home message of Wild by Design: Innovations from A to Zoo, a 45-minute live, hands-on science show debuting this fall in classrooms around the region to show students how technological advances often mimic nature. This August afternoon, the show, scripted and created by Hennessy and team, is being previewed for elementary and middle school-aged kids attending Science Center summer camps.\n\nThe bird-flinging, barrel-booming, sudsspilling show is part of Science on the Road, the Science Center’s outreach program. Wild by Design is the fifth Science on the Road program supported by PPG Industries and the first to involve a partnership between the Science Center and Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium, the local experts on all things wild-animal.\n\nThe show takes students on a virtual trip to both the zoo and the science lab with videos that demonstrate human problems and their animal solutions. Interviews with real-world chemists, animal trainers, and robotics engineers introduce students to career possibilities in science and immerse them in the design process.\n\nIn one segment, Sarah Topper, a chemist at PPG, says she’s in search of a new type of robot to spray paint a car, something flexible enough to get into its many nooks and crannies.\n\nEnter Willie Theison, the zoo’s lead elephant keeper, who appears on screen with Zuri, a teenage elephant with a whopping 40,000 muscles in its trunk that lend it the flexibility of a Slinky. The elephant’s unique anatomy, Theison explains, inspired a German robot maker to create a trunk-like arm that could paint cars easily.\n\nPhoto: Jim Judkis\n\nBut it’s not all show-and-tell. A handful of kids are called on stage and asked to stand next to a large inflatable elephant while dangling a Slinky to study its mechanics. They watch a slow-motion video of a Slinky falling six stories from the top of PPG Building Four, in downtown Pittsburgh. The kids marvel at how the top of the Slinky falls first, and it’s only when the top “catches up to” the bottom that the whole Slinky drops, due to the interplay of gravity and tension at work.\n\nNext up is Hennessy’s favorite animal innovation—the bumps on the fins of humpback whales that help them flow quickly through the ocean. Engineers put similar bumps on the blades of wind turbines, he explains, to help them rotate even in light winds. Smaller textured blades also help power computers.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, Hennessy flips the switch on a powerful leaf blower, unfurling a roll of toilet paper onto the nowscreaming kids, all of whom are reaching out for a piece of the white streamer. Introducing Bernoulli’s principle, he explains that air goes over the top of a curved surface with more speed, and beneath it with more pressure, lifting it upwards.\n\nThe concept is not lost on the kids. “I liked learning how you use animal features to make wind turbines go faster,” says 11-year-old Erick Ilkhanipour.\n\nThe grand finale ends with a big bang, thanks to the humble pinecone. The cones hold their seeds for decades, Hennessy explains, but when there’s a forest fire the heat melts the wax inside the cones, eventually causing them to break open. The seeds that are released help rejuvenate the forest. “It’s like Jiffy Pop,” says Hennessy of the time-release mechanism. Scientists use the same principle on heat-activated fire sprinklers.\n\nTo drive the lesson home, Hennessy places foam pinecones on top of a plastic trash can filled with hot water. He then adds liquid nitrogen to mimic the effect of wax inside the cone. Slowly the pressure builds until the top pops off the trash can with a loud bang, knocking the pinecones to the ground.\n\n“I liked the explosion,” says 8-year-old Nyla McGinnis. “It was a really loud boom. I learned that animals help make technology.” She also likes Hennessy. “He’s funny,” she says, grinning widely.\n\nZachary Fairfull, a 10-year-old science buff, loved all the live demos. “It was interesting to know that people see animal properties and then put them into projects or robots.”\n\nAmy O’Neill, development coordinator for the zoo, says Wild by Design helps make a strong argument for wildlife conservation. “It shows kids that there’s another reason to pay attention and take care of all the species on the planet, beyond them just being beautiful or cute,” she says. “Having biodiversity also provides something for us.”\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\n2013 Carnegie International  ·  Artist as Activist  ·  History Redux  ·  Artists In Their Own Words  ·  Frozen In Time  ·  The Stand-In  ·  Director’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Face Time: Lauren Talotta  ·  Science & Nature: Cultural Craftsman  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

Add San Francisco, London, Basel, and Toronto to the mix, and the international flavor of the Carnegie International refers to more than its art. It’s not just the audience who comes from far and wide. Financial support, thanks in large part to the Friends of the International, does, too. Created prior to the 2004-5 exhibition, Friends is a cadre of faithful museum patrons and contemporary art lovers across the country and the world who unite to support and promote the exhibition, in Pittsburgh and in their respective backyards.“People assume I live in Pittsburgh because I’m so involved,” says Jill Kraus, a New Yorker. “The reality is there are a lot of really wonderful things happening in art in Pittsburgh, and the International is a big part of that.”For Kraus, an avid contemporary art collector, it all started in Pittsburgh. As a freshman at Carnegie Mellon University, her world changed when she visited the 1970 International.\n\n“If it weren’t for the International,  I probably wouldn’t be a collector today,” says Kraus, now a Carnegie Mellon trustee. “I had never seen contemporary art before, and I was an art major. The International was my first exposure to what was going on.”\n\nIt’s this kind of passion, coupled with support from museum staff, that has helped grow the group’s membership from about 50 to more than 80 members since the last Carnegie International. And Richard Armstrong, the museum’s Henry J. Heinz II director, remains positive more will follow.\n\n“They’re informed people, so they’re part of the ongoing dialogue,” says Armstrong. “They’re also good allies all over the world because they act as ambassadors for the exhibition, the museum, the city.”\n\nIn fact, only about 30 Friends live in Western Pennsylvania; another 40 or so make their homes in or around New York City or California, one hails from Mexico, several are from Europe, and the remaining stretch across the United States in places like Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; Wayzata, Minnesota; and Dallas, Texas.\n\n“Nothing contributes to the vitality and prominence of Carnegie Museums throughout the world like the Carnegie International,” says Milton Fine, Carnegie Museums Trustee Emeritus and co-chair of the Friends group along with wife Sheila, Kraus and husband Peter, and Maja Oeri and Hans Bodenmann of Basel, Switzerland.\n\n“It establishes Pittsburgh as an important player in world culture, and it permits us to raise funds in far off places,” Fine adds.\n\nWith donations of $10,000 or more per person or couple, to date the Friends have contributed $555,000  for previous Carnegie Internationals plus $565,000 in additional gifts for the 2008 exhibition, for a total that exceeds $1 million. It costs about   $3.5 million to put on each exhibition.\n\n“The Friends understand the power of investing in the International. It’s been the yeast from which the museum has grown since 1896,” says Armstrong. “It has had a profound effect on the collection and on the audience’s perception of what contemporary art is, all the way back to the beginning—for better and for worse, because some moments have not  been as good as others.\n\n“But since the mid-1980s, it’s been one  successful exhibition after the other,” Armstrong continues. “And if you look around in our galleries and  compare what’s now in the collection against what other regional art   museums might have, the museum’s holdings have no peers.”\n\nIt’s this incredible contribution—to both the museum and the city—that inspired Fine and his wife Sheila to contribute, through the Fine Foundation, a $5 million gift in support of the long-term success of the Carnegie International, including the upcoming 55th installation. The largest gift ever earmarked for the International, it will also provide for the creation of the Fine Prize, to be awarded to an emerging artist from each Carnegie International.\n\n“It is my hope that with this gift by The Fine Foundation, we will  help to augment the commitment   of Pittsburgh to the pivotal role of this exhibition, and thereby promote its future viability and durability,” says Fine.\n\nKraus, who with husband Peter has committed another $1.5 million to help endow the International, says they’re proud to play a role in its   continued success. And both contend that they, also, benefit from their  association with the museum through Friends. The group of like-minded art lovers meets every four or five months, generally around other art events—sometimes in Europe, other times in Pittsburgh, for dinners and exclusive meetings with past and present International curators.\n\n“Some of the best curators in the world have curated the Carnegie International,” notes Kraus. “That’s a remarkable thing.”\n\nAs Armstrong puts it, imagine having the World Series in your backyard every three years.\n\n“The International is the World Series of Art.

If you were one of many students who dreaded\n\nthe hour spent in English class, you might find Carnegie\n\nMuseum of Art’s new approach to learning English\n\ninspiring. Art & Writing, the new 90-minute gallery\n\nprogram, uses firsthand encounters with art to inspire\n\ncreative writing. Developed in collaboration with educators\n\nand docents from Carnegie Museum of Art and English teachers\n\nfrom Bethel Park High School and launched at the start\n\nof the 2005 school season, it has teachers talking. And\n\nstudents writing.\n\n“\n\nIf you’ve ever experienced writer’s block,\n\nthis program is the ultimate cure,” Leigh Ann Totty\n\ntold her class of creative writing students at Bethel Park\n\nHigh School. “You’ll find endless characters,\n\nsettings, and plots just waiting to enter your stories.”\n\nTo\n\nTotty and other English teachers in the western Pennsylvania\n\nregion, the museum’s program is a dream come true.\n\nNot only does it make writing less intimidating and more\n\nfun than the expository writing exercises that dominate\n\nthe English curriculum, it also gives students something\n\nauthentic to write about.\n\nSays Carnegie Museum of Art’s\n\nCurator of Education Marilyn Russell: “Art is something\n\nabout which students can form an opinion and develop a\n\nresponse. It’s\n\nfull of deeply held beliefs that inspire genuine questions\n\nabout life and the human experience. Students need these\n\nthings to become good writers. They need to have something\n\nto say.”\n\nLike other school tours offered by Carnegie\n\nMuseum of Art, Art & Writing encourages students to\n\nlook closely at art while sharing ideas about what they\n\nsee. Unlike other\n\ntours, Art & Writing has less to do with historical\n\ncontext and more to do with imagination.\n\nEncouraged to\n\nput aside factual information they know about the art,\n\nmuseum docents prod students to use their imaginations\n\nto create story ideas inspired by what they see.\n\n“\n\nLet’s look at the young girl in the painting, the\n\none holding the books,” says docent Merle Culley\n\nto a group of eighth graders standing in front of the painting\n\nMorning on the Cape (1935) by American artist Leon Kroll. “What’s\n\ngoing through her mind?”\n\n“\n\nI think she’s sad because she doesn’t want\n\nto leave the farm. She doesn’t want to go to school,” one\n\nstudent says.\n\n“\n\nNo way,” someone else interjects. “I think\n\nshe’s bored with the farm. Just look at her face.\n\nShe looks like she’s dreaming of a life far away,\n\na life in a big city, maybe. Her fancy clothes don’t\n\nfit in with the farm.”\n\n“\n\nI’m not so sure,” a student from the back row\n\nsays. “To me, she’s not really bored with the\n\nfarm or sad to leave it. She’s dreaming of her future.\n\nMaybe she’s in love with a boy who left for the war,\n\nand she’s imagining life when he returns. She’s\n\nlooking at the pregnant lady, so maybe she’s dreaming\n\nof having her own baby.”\n\nIn a discussion that sounds\n\nmore introspective than one might expect from eighth graders,\n\nthe students offset each\n\nother’s ideas with visual evidence from the painting,\n\nmuch like a detective at a crime scene. The young girl’s\n\nglance away from the farm indicates a plan of escape, not\n\na sign of contentment. Her well-groomed hair and collared\n\nshirt suggest wealth, not poverty. And the two people in\n\nthe background, positioned in close proximity to the farm,\n\nrepresent an old way of life soon to be replaced by modernization.\n\nThese insights, which students share out loud and jot\n\ndown in journals, form the basis of narrative stories completed\n\nback in the classroom. Stories range from Medieval and\n\nmodern romances to snippets of daily life, complex dramas,\n\nand works of historical fiction.\n\nAccording to Kathleen\n\nAntonazzo, a language arts teacher at Saints Peter and\n\nPaul School, Art & Writing inspired\n\nsuch a wide range of stories that it became not just a\n\nlesson in writing but also a lesson in tolerance of multiple\n\nperspectives. “The fact that students extracted such\n\ndifferent ideas from the same works of art made them more\n\nopen-minded and accepting of different viewpoints. They\n\nultimately learned that there’s more than one way\n\nto look at something.”\n\nWhile Art & Writing provides\n\na breath of fresh air for English teachers and students,\n\nit also supports the\n\neducational objectives of schools, which prioritize writing\n\nas an essential part of learning in all academic subjects.\n\n“\n\nTo the extent that we can be of service to the needs of\n\nteachers and students, we want to do as much as we can\n\nto help,” Russell explains. “With galleries\n\nfull of original art from distant time periods and places,\n\nthe museum is a perfect place for enhancing exactly what\n\nschools need to develop—speaking and writing skills,\n\ncritical thinking, reasoning, creativity, and tolerance.”\n\nFrom\n\nthe thoughtful observations articulated in the galleries\n\nto the polished stories produced in the classroom, Art & Writing\n\noffers a fresh approach that makes students eager to write. “Kids\n\nare your toughest critic,” says Freedom Area High\n\nSchool teacher Susan Rigotti. “The fact that Art & Writing\n\nheld my students’ attention speaks volumes about\n\nthe program.” And it keeps them writing volumes,\n\ntoo.\n\nTeachers interested in learning\n\nmore about innovative techniques to help make their students\n\nbetter communicators can participate\n\nin an Art & Writing workshop at Carnegie Museum of Art\n\non July 26.

PHOTO: Lisa\n\nKyle\n\nChildren’s Hospital volunteer\n\nChristy Linder lends a hand.\n\nBack\n\nChildren’s Hospital of Pittsburgh can be a sad place.\n\nOften it’s an inspiring place. But for kids in the\n\nhospital for a long stay, it can be a boring place. Add\n\nvolunteers from neighboring Carnegie Museum of Natural\n\nHistory, and once a week it’s also a very busy learning\n\nplace.\n\nIn the ninth floor activity room, a group of kids\n\nages 3 to 9 dressed in colorful pajamas and hospital gowns\n\ngather\n\naround a table just their size, gluing small puffs of cotton\n\nonto paper rabbits. Each child is given a plaster baby\n\nbunny and a small paper cup filled with cut raffia to mimic\n\ndried grass.\n\n“Do you know what the mother bunny does then?” asks Lenore Adler,\n\nprogram specialist for outreach at Carnegie Museum of Natural History. “She\n\npulls fur from her own body to make the nest soft for her baby bunny.” Impressed\n\nby this news, the kids quickly pull from a chunk of cotton to line their cups,\n\nmaking the nest comfortable for their own baby bunnies.\n\nAdler shows a mounted\n\nrabbit skeleton to the older kids remaining at the table. “See the\n\nextra long legs?” she\n\nasks. “See the big teeth? That’s why you\n\nnever pet a wild rabbit.”\n\nThis natural history\n\nlesson is one of dozens shared by way of Carnegie Museum\n\nof Natural History’s Museum\n\non the Move program, which for 25 years has delivered\n\nthe resources of the museum to special-needs children.\n\nOnce\n\na week at Children’s, volunteers share lessons\n\nabout dinosaurs, Native Americans, backyard birds, fabulous\n\nfelines,\n\nor rocks and minerals.\n\nThe programs are structured to\n\nbe flexible in their complexity depending on the age\n\nand interest of the audience—with\n\nany given week being different, usually a mix from toddlers\n\nto teens. According to Carol Lerberg, a volunteer with\n\nthe program for 20 years, dinosaurs are the most popular,\n\nno matter the age. “The little kids play with the\n\ndinosaur toys, and the older kids look at the teeth and\n\nfossils.” A Short Walk, A Big Step\n\nOn a spring day in 1982, Carnegie Museum of Natural History\n\neducator Diane Grzybek, now chair of the museum’s\n\ndivision of education, made the short walk from the Oakland\n\nmuseum over to Children’s Hospital, a box of materials\n\nall about dinosaurs in her arms. It was a simple gesture:\n\ntake some of what kids love about the museum to children\n\nwho can’t visit the museum because of illness.\n\nGrzybek gives credit for the idea to Sally Randall,\n\na museum docent who a year earlier had wondered out loud\n\nwhy the\n\nmuseum couldn’t travel outside its own walls to people\n\nwho could really use a wonderful diversion. Still today,\n\nMuseum on the Move is a one-of-kind program. “There\n\nreally is nothing like it in the country,” Grzybek\n\nnotes.\n\nToday, Museum on the Move visits more than 60 organizations,\n\nincluding acute-care hospitals, elementary schools, camps,\n\nHead Start centers, and several women’s shelters.\n\nIn 2005, volunteers presented some 600 programs to more\n\nthan 8,500 children.\n\n“\n\nIt is a very labor-intensive program,” says Grzybek,\n\nwho was the first director of the program. “It’s\n\na lot of work for the volunteers, but it’s a labor\n\nof love. Once they see kids get involved, the volunteers\n\nget hooked.”\n\nA Wednesday morning staple at Children’s,\n\nvolunteers conduct different presentations simultaneously\n\non three\n\nfloors. And Children’s keeps asking them back. “It’s\n\ninteresting\n\nand educational—and a distraction.If kids can’t\n\nmake it to the activity room, volunteers go to their bedside,” says\n\nDenise Esposto, manager of the Child Life department at\n\nthe hospital. She’s\n\nresponsible for the activities that address the emotional\n\nand social needs of their patients.\n\n“\n\nThe program works on a compassionate, human level,” says\n\nAdler, who joined Museum on the Move in 1997.\n\nLike Gryzbek before her, she is the program’s only\n\nfull-time paid staff member. Still, Adler points out that\n\na lot has\n\nchanged\n\nover the past 25 years.\n\nEleven volunteers now round out\n\nthe program. The museum gets to store materials at Children’s\n\nHospital for its weekly presentations. And Museum on\n\nthe Move staff\n\nnow even get to use a van for their special brand of special\n\ndeliveries.\n\nBack\n\n\\| Top\n\nHome \\| Feature\n\n1 \\| Feature 2 \\| Feature\n\n3 \\| Feature 4 \\| President’s\n\nNote \\| NewsWorthy \\| Now\n\nShowing \\| Face Time \\| About\n\nTown \\|\n\nCopyright (c)\n\n2006 CARNEGIE Magazine.

The assignment came as part\n\nof an architectural learning forum held this summer at\n\nCarnegie Museum of Art.\n\nFor Matela, the forum—called\n\na “charette,” or\n\na design brainstorming session—marked a chance to\n\nsample the design experience from beginning to end. “I\n\nreally liked the charette,” says Matela, who will\n\nbegin studying industrial design at Pratt Institute in\n\nBrooklyn this fall. “It proved useful seeing how\n\nprofessional people work and how the thought processes\n\nevolve.”\n\nFor Museum of Art staff, the charette opened\n\na new door on how to help museum visitors shape their experiences\n\nwhen they visit. The museum is not alone, however, in its\n\nstrong desire to have its audiences take ownership of their\n\nvisits. The Andy Warhol Museum, City Theater, The Pittsburgh\n\nBallet and The Pittsburgh Symphony are all just as eager\n\nto achieve the same goal.\n\nEnter The Heinz Endowments Arts\n\nExperience Initiative. The initiative has given each of\n\nthe five institutions\n\ntwo-year, $50,000 grants to experiment with ways to get\n\ncultural arts participants more involved in the exhibitions\n\nand events they attend. The ultimate goal: to change how\n\nthey view their “customers” and to deeply engage\n\ntheir audiences in the subject matter.\n\nJanet Sarbaugh, director\n\nof The Heinz Endowments’ Arts & Culture\n\nProgram, says, “Our planning process led us to believe\n\nwe should be supporting projects that encourage cultural\n\naudiences to be more actively involved in the venue they\n\nare attending. So we set aside some funds to experiment\n\nwith like-minded institutions interested in delving into\n\nthis concept.”\n\n“\n\nThe initiative’s funded projects are trying to get\n\naway from the ‘talking head’ kind of thing\n\nand much more into the experiential process. But it takes\n\nmoney, time, and the willingness to fail,” says Lynne\n\nConner, a professor of theater and history at the University\n\nof Pittsburgh, who is also an expert on audience engagement\n\nand the principal investigator for the initiative.\n\nThe\n\nMuseum of Art’s charette, which focused on the\n\nexhibition Michael Maltzan: Alternate Ground,\n\nbrought together five teams of local high school and college\n\nstudents as\n\nwell as professional architects from Pittsburgh and Los\n\nAngeles. Each team was given a local urban site and asked\n\nto consider how they would incorporate two unrelated types\n\nof buildings on it. Their work sessions took place in the\n\nMuseum of Art’s Hall of Sculpture, where other museum\n\nvisitors could view their sketches and models and hear\n\nthe students’ final presentations. At The Andy Warhol\n\nMuseum, the staff is using their funding to revise the\n\nmuseum’s signage and transform several\n\ncorridors to create an easier-to-navigate experience as\n\nwell as one that encourages more discussion of exhibitions.\n\nFor example, during the exhibition Andy Warhol’s\n\nTime Capsules, one of the hallways held a photocopier that\n\nvisitors could use to “transform their everyday” just\n\nlike Warhol did with his Time Capsules collection. Visitors\n\ncould photocopy items in their purses and pockets and display\n\nthem in the museum beside Warhol’s collectibles.\n\nCity\n\nTheater is using its grant money to fund and market discussion\n\npanels called “Text and Context” sessions,\n\nwriting workshops, and lectures related to its plays, says\n\nLisa Remby, the theater’s marketing director. Recently,\n\nthe theater had a panel of Frank Lloyd Wright fellows speak\n\nabout the famous architect in connection with the theater’s\n\nproduction Work Song: Three Views of Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\n“The ‘Text and Context’ sessions help\n\nus enhance the experience of coming to the play. The more\n\nyou know\n\nabout the author and background, the more you get out of\n\nthe play itself,” Remby says.\n\nFor its part, the Pittsburgh\n\nSymphony has experimented with several projects, the most\n\ncontroversial being setting\n\nup two screens that project written messages during concert\n\ndowntimes. A screen might give context about the show’s\n\nsecond half or a particular song before it begins, explains\n\nRobert Moir, the symphony’s vice president of artistic\n\nplanning. There are also regular “talk-back sessions” when\n\nmembers of the audience can stay afterward to talk about\n\nthe music. “We hope to provide a forum where audience\n\nmembers can extend the concert experience for another hour,” Moir\n\nsays.\n\nAt the Pittsburgh Ballet, the staff is using The Heinz\n\nEndowments funds to enhance some of its existing programs\n\nand create others. Ballet patrons can look behind the scenes\n\nwith the “Family Point” program prior to a\n\nSaturday afternoon matinee. And “Talks with Terry” allow\n\nticket holders to come before a show to talk about the\n\nproduction with Terrence Orr, the Ballet’s artistic\n\ndirector, while dancers rehearse on stage behind him.\n\nIn\n\nthe case of the Museum of Art’s charette, it was\n\na true experiment that was in marked contrast to the all-too-common\n\nbreeze through an art exhibition. According to Karen Knutson,\n\none of the evaluators for the initiative and the associate\n\ndirector of arts and humanities at UPCLOSE, the University\n\nof Pittsburgh’s Center for Learning in Out of School\n\nEnvironments, “Participants got an incredibly rich,\n\nonce-in-a-lifetime experience, and they brought their families\n\non board, too. It really set the ‘gold standard’ for\n\nmuseum audiences making an exhibition their own.”\n\nBack\n\n\\| Top\n\nHome \\| NewsWorthy \\| Now\n\nShowing \\| Face Time \\| About\n\nTown \\| Family Matters \\| Artistic\n\nLicense\n\nFirst Person \\| Another\n\nLook \\| Then & Now\n\nCopyright\n\n(c) 2005 CARNEGIE Magazine.

Reprinted with permission\n\nAs far as the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh (AAP) is concerned, some benchmarks are more about a constancy of purpose than a measure of change. Celebrating its centennial year,    this predominately volunteer-driven, artist-run organization is the oldest continuously exhibiting visual arts group in the country. Founded in 1910 when traditional landscapes, portraits, and still lifes ruled, AAP has remained relevant by providing artists with the means to see and be seen.Its most prestigious event, the Annual, is open to all artists 18 years of age and older living within a 150-mile radius of Pittsburgh. It’s this vehicle that has enabled AAP not only to survive, but also to present more regional art to the public than any other group in the city. At last count, in its first 50 years alone, more than 10,000 works were displayed—some created by artists exhibiting for the very first time (a statistic that makes AAP very proud). More often than not, this juried exhibition, dubbed “Popular Salon of the People” by the Pittsburgh Press, has  been held at Carnegie Museum of Art. The 2010 show opens at the museum on July 24.Throughout the decades, the Annual has served as an artistic-affirming, resume-building, and buzz-generating event for the likes of Mary Cassatt, Edward Hopper, Philip Pearlstein, and Andy Warhol.Add to that list Lizzy DeVita. Her entries in the last three Annuals caught the eye of a local gallery owner and, as  a result, have earned this East Liberty resident a solo show in 2011.Growing up in Pittsburgh, DeVita, not unlike Warhol, couldn’t wait to leave town. But soon after graduating from New York City’s Barnard College and landing a job with a “fancy” printmaking company, she began to find the Big Apple a bit daunting. “At this point in my career, which is the beginning,” the 23-year-old says, “it occurred to me that it might be a deterrent to stay in New York because art is so market-driven there.” She made the decision to move back to her hometown and quickly took a job with a non-profit agency that affords her enough money to eat and enough time to explore her art. For Chilean-born Alberto Almarza, an artist and teacher, Pittsburgh has provided fertile ground to grow his artistic sensibilities. According to Almarza, who arrived here 10 years ago when he was just 18, the city and art are in sync. “Pittsburgh offers a whole range of artistic expression,” he says, “from galleries and museums to street art, computer geeks, and punks.”That’s not quite the picture Robert Qualters would have painted as a young artist living and working in Pittsburgh some 40 years ago. Now 76, he recalls the local art scene, circa the 1960s, bordering on “desolate.” In fact, Qualters adds, “I can’t remember any commercial galleries.”Although they have traveled different paths, these artists share a common thread: the AAP, home to many of the region’s visual artists who help define the art scene in Pittsburgh. With its ranks approaching the 500 mark, the group has a membership more diverse than many may assume, although it wasn’t always that way. “We have a wonderfully rich history,” AAP president Kathleen Zimbicki asserts; not    to mention a reputation for skewing toward an older, more female membership. But just as Pittsburgh’s rap as a still-smoky city no longer holds true, neither does AAP’s.     “We encourage new older people and new young people to join,” the  75-year-old from Carnegie notes. As further evidence, Zimbicki points to AAP’s new director, Jeanine Hall, who happens to be under 30.After “just kind of ending up here” in 2006, the 26-year-old Hall has spent her time working on her own art, volunteering at the Mattress Factory and Brew House Association, earning a degree from Carnegie Mellon University in arts management, serving as the director of UnSmoke Systems Artspace in Braddock, and now, following a stint as an administrative assistant at AAP, taking on her new role as its managing director.Interestingly enough, Hall is not exactly in love with Pittsburgh, although she does appreciate its affordability. “There is a lot of potential here for artists looking to start or have a home base,” says Hall, who moved from Baltimore, Maryland, and now lives in Braddock. “The town has grown on me. I’m here for now definitely, but I’m not the settling kind.”By contrast, Qualters did opt to stay. He settled in Squirrel Hill, raised a family, and maintained his painting career. Still on the job in his West Homestead studio, he takes on commissioned projects and his own flights of fancy. He was also instrumental in organizing AAP’s recent exhibition designed to bring emerging and experienced artists together, noting that even at his age, he continues to grow and change as an artist. “I do think my work is less descriptive and  more open to fantastic interpretations,” Qualters says. The first thing Almarza says about his art work is that it’s hard to describe. “Most of what I do,” he explains, “is take internal landscapes—emotions and dream states—and turn them into physical form.”Also taking physical form for Almarza are his family, his Bloomfield home, and his classroom at Pittsburgh’s Creative and Performing Arts High School. “Teaching visual arts to sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-graders is definitely different from doing my own art and definitely fulfilling,” Almarza says. “It’s the ideal job.” Regardless of age or mailing address, artists are more alike than not. “In essential ways,” Qualters asserts, “we’re the same.” And for the past 100 years and counting, AAP has been celebrating the similarities as well as the differences.\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nGrowing Up With Science  ·  The Disappeared  ·  Ode to a Collection  ·  Twisted Pair  ·  Special Supplement: A Tribute to Our Donors  ·  Directors’ Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Face Time: Zhe-Xi Luo  ·  Artistic License: Domestic Explorations  ·  Science & Nature: Geological Wonder  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

Yet these science fair alumni, gathered at Carnegie Science Center to celebrate the annual event’s 75th anniversary, could easily recollect their projects.\n\n“Oh, I still have parts of it at home,” George Guzik says, with a chuckle. The Westinghouse engineer, who’s been a PRSEF volunteer and judge for the past 18 years, describes how his “vortex tube” took in compressed air and then generated a flow of hot air and a flow of cold air. “It probably wasn’t the most impressive project, but it worked.”\n\nGerry Vaerewyck, vice president of engineering at Vere, a New Kensington-based company that makes and sells laser systems and components, had no problem remembering his projects: “One year I produced alcohol from water hyacinths; another year my project was about measuring radiation; another year it was on smoking,” he says.\n\n“I identified dominant and recessive genes for ultraviolet pigments in fruit flies,” notes Rob Thompson, who went on to develop software for the insurance industry, launch his own software company, and then sell it to ITT. Today, he’s one of the region’s most passionate advocates for science learning and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) careers, serving on the Science Center board and establishing a family fund along with his wife, Diane, to support organizations that enhance STEM education initiatives in schools.\n\nDolores Viehman—daughter of an engineer, who became an engineer in the ‘70s, married an engineer, and whose daughter participated in this year’s science fair and plans to become a third-generation engineer—had alittle help recalling her projects. “My father saved them,” she says. “When he passed away we found them in his house.” One of them looked at the byproducts of coal; another looked at temperature and how a thermometer performed when it was wet and when it was dry.\n\nAccording to Science Center estimates, a remarkable 50,000-plus students have participated in the science fair since its debut in 1939. This year’s event attracted 1,100 students in grades 6-12, representing 23 counties in western Pennsylvania, three counties in West Virginia, and one county in Maryland. Most student participants were finalists from their own school science fairs.\n\nBut a lot has changed since the days when PRSEF literally took over the former Buhl Planetarium. “I remember being on the steps of a back stairwell with my project,” notes Vaerewyck, who participated from 1974 to 1980. Today’s PRSEF, which is a project of the Science Center’s Chevron Center for STEM Education and Career Development, takesplace in the Grand Hall of Heinz Field. And while it’s still an annual right of passage for science-minded students throughout western Pennsylvania, it’s also become serious business for young people looking to build careers in the sciences.\n\n“The regional science fair is central to our mission because it fosters a love of science in generations of young people, but also because it cultivates interest in STEM careers,” says Ann Metzger, The Henry Buhl, Jr., Co-Director of Carnegie Science Center, who adds that she and Co-Director Ron Baillie get “charged up” just walking through the fair’s massive exhibit areas.\n\n“The best are getting better, and they’ll be the ones who will change the world.”\n\n– Rob Thompson, PRSEF Alumnus\n\nThe annual event now has scores of regional sponsors—a who’s-who of corporate and educational leaders who, like Metzger and Baillie and their team at the Science Center, get fired up about nurturing the STEM leaders of the future. This year’s presenting sponsors were California University of Pennsylvania, Chevron, FedEx Ground, Kennametal, The Grable Foundation, and United States Steel, and at least 40 more organizations supported PRSEF at other sponsor levels. All told, more than $1 million in cash awards, scholarships, trophies, and trips were distributed by participating organizations at the awards ceremony on March 29. Sponsors gave out more than 150 awards, and 18 colleges and universities literally vied for the attention of PRSEF’s senior competitors, awarding tens of thousands of dollars in scholarships.\n\nHundreds of professionals from industry and academia also served as science fair judges, many returning year after year for the sheer pleasure of seeing the remarkable work of the doctors, engineers, scientists, software developers, and technology entrepreneurs of the future. “The teenage mind is still growing,” said David Pearlman, director of student aid at Penn State Altoona, as he announced his school’s scholarship awardees this year. “So we can’t wait to see what you do next year!”\n\nThe sky’s the limit on what that could be, Thompson notes. The Thompsons are so enthusiastic about the science fair that this year they introduced their own PRSEF scholarship awards, which benefited two high school seniors. “The best are getting better,” he says, “and they’ll be the ones who will change the world.” Without a doubt, among this year’s best was Suvir Mirchandani, a ninth grader who impressed the judges with his “Fuzzy Logic Based Web Browser for the Disabled,” and then went on to compete in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) in Los Angeles.\n\nBut it was Suvir’s sixth-grade PRSEF project that had everyone talking at Heinz Field in March. After being inundated with paper in middle school, he got the bright idea to calculate how much less ink it would take to print a document using the Garamond font (with its thinner strokes) as opposed to other popular fonts, including the Times Roman font used at his school. The young science wiz eventually estimated that his school could save $21,000 a year and the U.S. government could save as much as $230 million annually by switching fonts.\n\nAfter receiving such a positive response to his initial research, last year Suvir created a video based on his cost-saving idea and entered it in another Science Center program, the i5 Digital Video Competition. This past March, his research findings were published in Science. And for a short time during the week of this year’s science fair, as his fellow competitors were standing their ground near their project boards, Suvir had to excuse himself to be interviewed by CNN.\n\n“I’ve reviewed some of the ISEF projects, and I just shake my head,” says science fair alumnus Guzik. “These young people are really doing impressive work.”\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nAndy Warhol, Revealed  ·  Rockhound  ·  Picture This  ·  Small Prints, Big Artists  ·  Special Section: A Tribute to Our Donors  ·  Director’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Face Time: Catherine Evans  ·  Artistic License: Home-field Advantage  ·  Science & Nature: Big Blue  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

Guided by a live performer donning a tie-dyed\n\nlab coat, students will become “color cadets” and\n\nsolve science puzzlers in an elaborate production that’s\n\npart video, part stage performance, part chemical kabooms,\n\nand all fun. In the fight for truth, justice, and the scientific\n\nmethod, the cadets must save the City of Spectropolis from\n\nMonochrome, an evil villain plotting to rob the city of\n\nall its color.\n\nThroughout the 45-minute show, students\n\nwill learn about color and light, how the eye sees them,\n\nand how the mind\n\ncan be tricked into misinterpreting them. They will also\n\nexperiment with dry ice and acid-based reactions that will\n\ndemonstrate how adjusting the pH of liquids can change\n\ntheir color. The show will end with a bang—colorful\n\nexplosions of hydrogen balloons filled with salts, the\n\nsame chemical reactions used in real fireworks. To reinforce\n\nthese lessons, Science on the Road will even provide teachers\n\nwith activities students can do in the classroom before\n\nand after the show.\n\n“\n\nIt’s a really dramatic way for students to see how\n\nscience works,” says Jessica Stricker, director of\n\neducation experiences at Carnegie Science Center.\n\n“\n\nThe Great Color Caper” is the first of three productions\n\nfunded by a gift of more than $400,000 from PPG Industries\n\nFoundation (a show on glass is slated for September 2007\n\nand one on chemistry for September 2008). The gift has\n\nmade “The Great Color Caper” an exciting, immersive\n\nexperience unlike anything Science on the Road has offered\n\nbefore, with its own sound and video equipment and props\n\nstraight out of a comic book. A 10-foot backdrop of the\n\nSpectropolis cityscape sets the scene with the prism-like\n\nspire of PPG Place refracting sunlight into a rainbow beaming\n\nthrough the sky.\n\nPPG’s research teams worked closely\n\nwith Carnegie Science Center to create fun ways that the\n\ncompany’s\n\nglass and pigment technologies could be used to illustrate\n\nconcepts covered in Pennsylvania’s science curriculum.\n\nThroughout the show, real-life scientists conduct actual\n\nlaboratory work on-screen and explain basic-science concepts\n\nto help the cadets along the way.\n\n“\n\nWe’re so pleased to be able to help students understand\n\nscience and technology—and realize that it can be\n\nfun,” says Sue Sloan, senior program officer of PPG\n\nIndustries Foundation. “We hope it makes an impact\n\non them in thinking about the future.”\n\n“\n\nIt really is the most spectacular show that we’ve\n\never produced here,” says Stricker—so spectacular,\n\nin fact, that it called for its very own wheels. Painted\n\nentirely using PPG’s cutting-edge technologies, the\n\nshow’s customized van is a traveling science exhibit\n\nall its own, featuring a brilliant display of specially\n\nmanufactured glasses and paints. The bumpers change color\n\nwith the light, and the windows feature special glass that\n\nappears yellow from the inside and blue from the outside,\n\nas well as infra-red-absorbent and infra-red-reflecting\n\ntechnologies that make some windows feel hot to the touch\n\nand others feel cool. Both the van and the production will\n\nshow the students real-world applications of concepts they\n\nare learning in\n\nschool—a goal of the Science on the Road program\n\nsince its inception in 1983. Today the program reaches\n\n225,000 students throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia,\n\nMaryland, and New York each year, covering a variety of\n\ncontent—from sound waves to space travel, heat and\n\ncombustion to human growth and development. Through interactive\n\npresentations and hands-on activities, Science on the Road\n\nbrings lessons to life in classrooms, large assemblies,\n\nafter-school workshops, camps, and even birthday parties\n\n(liquid-nitrogen ice cream, anyone?).\n\n“\n\nWe’re all about inspiring curiosity,” says\n\nStricker. “We want students to think of science as\n\nbeing cool and fun and exciting—something that they\n\ncan do, something meaningful to everyday life, even a possible\n\ncareer choice.”\n\n“\n\nThe Great Color Caper” is sure to be a popular new\n\naddition to Science on the Road’s programming; a\n\nsingle postcard mailing announcing its debut has already\n\nlined up more than 20 bookings. The show and its van debut\n\nat the Science Center September 16 and 17. Immediately\n\nfollowing a press event at the Science Center on the 18th,\n\nthe van will be parked at PPG Place for the public to view.\n\nOn the 23rd, the Caper crew will bring the show to Pittsburgh\n\nZoo & PPG Aquarium to offer performances throughout\n\nthe day. From there, it’s off to the schools.\n\nFor more information about\n\nScience on the Road, visit www.carnegiesciencecenter.org or call 412.237.3374.

Called Urban Revolution, it’s one of\n\nthe Museum of Art’s Architecture Camps and Workshops,\n\na new addition to the museum’s Summer Arts program.\n\n“\n\nWhen Marilyn \\[Russell\\] called to say ‘let’s\n\npartner,’ I was very excited,” recalls Kelly\n\nDocter, K-12 Outreach Coordinator for Carnegie Mellon’s\n\nSchool of Architecture. Russell, chair and curator of education\n\nfor Carnegie Museum of Art, knew she would be incorporating\n\narchitecture into the museum’s summer-camp mix for\n\n2005; she just wasn’t exactly sure what form it would\n\ntake.\n\n“\n\nI realized that both organizations were trying to do the\n\nsame thing—give kids rich experiences exploring architecture\n\nfrom a number of different perspectives,” Russell\n\nsays. “The\n\nMuseum of Art has an incredible collection that includes\n\npaintings, drawings, architectural models, and the Hall\n\nof Architecture; and Carnegie Mellon\n\nhas professional facilities and tremendous expertise in\n\nthe teaching of\n\narchitecture. Why not join forces and make those experiences\n\nfor kids even better? That’s the beauty of this kind\n\nof collaboration; it benefits everyone.”\n\nAll architecture camps for\n\n11-13 year-olds and high school kids will take place on\n\nthe Carnegie Mellon campus, where\n\nclass space is more plentiful, and instructors from the\n\nUniversity’s School of Architecture will lead the\n\ncamps. Participants will also spend time exploring images\n\nof cities in Carnegie Museum of Art’s collection\n\nof paintings and in the Heinz Architectural Center, where\n\nRussell and Docter are working with Curator Tracy Myers\n\nto organize an installation of complementary drawings and\n\nmodels from the Center’s collections.\n\nUrban Revolution goes a step further by taking kids out of the university\n\nand museum setting and challenging them to really think\n\nbig. As Docter points out, Urban Revolutionists will\n\nhave one of the best cities in the country, if not the\n\nworld, to explore as a case study: Pittsburgh.\n\n“\n\nThis is a wonderful city to get kids to appreciate the\n\nold while also thinking about the new,” Docter says. “We\n\nhave fabulous buildings in Pittsburgh.” And, thanks\n\nto the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, kids\n\nin the two-week Urban Revolution program will tour some\n\nof Pittsburgh’s best\n\nvintage architectural treasures. The Riverlife Task Force\n\nis also pitching in to give the kids a look at the riverfronts\n\nand an assessment of current and future development along\n\nPittsburgh’s waterways.\n\nFinally, after seeing for\n\nthemselves all that city planners, architects, and builders\n\nhave to contend with when creating,\n\nmaintaining, and modernizing cities, Urban Revolutionists\n\nwill return to the museum and the Carnegie Mellon studio\n\nto design a city of their own. Docter says they’ll\n\nfirst have to consider three important elements of any\n\ncity plan: housing, open space, and commercial/industrial\n\nspace. They’ll also be asked to think about all that\n\na city should have in it.\n\n“\n\nIt’s interesting what comes to mind when you ask\n\nkids to think about the important elements of a city,” Docter\n\nnotes. “Boys often think first about things like\n\nsports stadiums—but when you ask them what would\n\nhappen if their sports stadium catches fire, they remember, ‘oh\n\nyeah, we need a fire station!’ It’s a great\n\nexercise; the kids soon realize that things like a jailhouse,\n\na fire station, and theaters are integral to a city.”\n\nThe\n\nmost important thing kids will take away from the two-week\n\nUrban Revolution, Docter says, is the iterative nature\n\nof the whole process: the constant discussion; the thinking\n\nand rethinking.\n\n“\n\nThis is an incredibly important part of design,” she\n\nnotes—and, as these kids will learn, it’s the\n\npart of planning the buildings and cities of tomorrow that\n\nyou can’t learn in a textbook.\n\n“This\n\nis a wonderful city to get kids to appreciate\n\nthe old while also thinking\n\nabout the new. We have fabulous\n\nbuildings in Pittsburgh.”\n\n– Kelly Docter, Carnegie\n\nMellon School of Architecture\n\nTo learn\n\nmore about Carnegie Museum of Art’s Summer\n\nArts and Architecture Camps and Workshops, review the Calendar\n\ninsert in this magazine, visit www.cmoa.org, or call 412.622.3288.\n\nRegistration is open throughout the summer months, and\n\nscholarships are available.\n\nBack\n\n\\| Top\n\nHome \\| NewsWorthy \\| Now\n\nShowing \\| Face Time \\| About\n\nTown \\| Family Matters \\| Artistic\n\nLicense\n\nScience & Nature \\| Another\n\nLook \\| Travel Log \\| Then & Now\n\nCopyright\n\n(c) 2005 CARNEGIE Magazine.

Well, at least in the movies. But here in “Roboburgh,” the recent announcement that a boat-load of ’bots will soon descend upon Carnegie Science Center is cause for a regional celebration. Early next year, much of the second floor of the popular North Shore destination will transform into roboworld, a 6,400-square-foot showcase of 30 hands-on, interactive exhibits that zero in on the latest advances in robotic development. Both educational and entertaining, roboworld will blend high-tech reality with science-fiction fantasy to appeal to a wide range of interests and audiences. And the Science Center, with one successful robotics exhibit under its belt already, believes there’s no better place for it. “Roboworld would be a great attraction here, in Des Moines, Iowa, or anywhere else,” says Jo Haas, the Henry Buhl, Jr. director of the Science Center. “But it makes sense in Pittsburgh because of the region’s many achievements on the world stage of robotic technology. With roboworld, we’re committed to putting a lens on the amazing things that are happening here at companies like Aethon, Automatika, and Integrated Industrial Technologies among others.” Not so coincidentally, many of those “amazing things” can be found at Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment Technology Center and its Robotics Institute, major partners in the project that, once completed, will be the largest and most comprehensive robotics exhibit in the nation. “Carnegie Mellon is inarguably in the forefront of robot innovation,” continues Haas. “However, it isn’t set up to give the general public an inside look at what it does. By working together, we can present an informal educational look at the hardcore science and technology happening at the university. When you add in the entertainment value of the Science Center, you really have a homerun.” To be sure, roboworld will touch all the bases. The groundbreaking, $3.4-million attraction will lead visitors through three focus areas: robot sensing, thinking, and acting. To better understand what makes the machines tick, visitors will discover how robots “see” and “hear,” how they process information, and how they do everything from walk, roll, climb, fly, grasp items, and work with tools. Visitors will even be able to create and test their own robots in an interactive workshop designed to expose younger audiences to a new world of academic and career opportunities in the high-tech field.“Since 1980, the United States has dropped from first to sixth in  the world in terms of the number   of engineers graduating from our colleges,” notes Ron Baillie, the Science Center’s chief program officer. “Right here in Pittsburgh   and across the country, so many high-tech jobs remain open because there aren’t enough people with the skills to fill them. Robotics has been  shown as one of the ways to engage youngsters at an early age in a way that can lead to their pursuit of   technology-related careers.” In fact, Haas sees roboworld as a breeding ground for future talent to develop and thrive right here in western Pennsylvania. “We want to assume a major role in workforce development with roboworld,” she says. “We are going to concretely connect the exhibit to the major science and technology sectors in this region. The goal is to  have children interact with robots here  at the Science Center and realize that robots are being made right here in their own backyard.” At CMU, principal scientist and roboworld advisor David Bourne says that the Robotics Institute’s involvement stems from the shared desire to inspire young people to pursue the sciences as a career. “Ultimately, we want our children to become the world’s leading scientists,” says Bourne, who helped design the Science Center’s groundbreaking 1996 robotics exhibit that still travels around the country today. “This partnership allows us at CMU to flow our technology to the Science Center so that students are exposed to robots in a way that will spark their imaginations.” For Kim Amey, the exhibit’s project manager, the goals are even more wide ranging. On board with the project since this past January, she’s connecting with local businesses and educational institutions to broaden roboworld appeal. “We want to make roboworld a major destination for people from around the world who are interested in this type of technology” says Amey. “As a tourist attraction, roboworld is a great economic tool. As a promotional tool, it’s going to be a great way to use local technology to showcase regional innovation.” While roboworld will spotlight the area’s achievements, it will also be the home of some of this planet’s and other planet’s most famous mechanical marvels in a special section of the exhibit dedicated to the Robot Hall of Fame™, which was created by CMU in 2003.­ “It would be great if roboworld had the same effect on a youngster as the planetarium had on Mike Fincke when he was a kid,” says Haas, referring to the Emsworth native who grew up to become a scientist and NASA astronaut. “He tells people how he spent so many hours looking at the stars on the old Buhl Dome and then grew up to be an astronaut. I would love to hear a young man or woman come up to me 10 years from now and say that he or she is working in robotics because of roboworld. We want to inspire kids to be the next generation of robot innovators.”\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nCelebrating the Mark that Makes Us Human  ·  Voices From Mars  ·  American Doggedness and the Carnegie International  ·  Clash of the Tyrant Lizards  ·  Hip to Be Square  ·  Special Supplement: Thanks to Our Donors  ·  Director’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Now Showing  ·  Face Time: Sam Taylor  ·  Field Trip: Red Hot Find  ·  Science & Nature: Ready, Set, Go!

He helps me stretch my imagination.”\n\n– Madelyn Roehrig\n\nA local artist-educator discovers that she’s not alone in her quest to channel her inner Andy Warhol.\n\nBy Julie Hannon\n\nMadelyn Roehrig visits Andy Warhol’s gravesite every day—for a year and counting.\n\nEver wonder what outrageous ideas Andy Warhol would dream up in this digital age of push-button publishing, instant status updates, and 24-hour news? Now you can ask him.\n\nAsking Andy anything is the idea behind Madelyn Roehrig’s ongoing art project, Figments: Conversations with Andy, in which the artist-educator is documenting who visits the late artist’s grave and, more interestingly, why.\n\nLast February, Roehrig left a notebook at Warhol’s hillside gravesite in Bethel Park, about 10 miles south of Pittsburgh, encouraging visitors to ask Andy a question or leave a comment. Since then, she’s collected 230 handwritten messages—along with a white wig, a plastic penis, a rosary, paint brushes, crystals, Gas-X pills, a Celebrity tomato plant, numerous Coca-Cola bottles, and a plethora of Campbell’s soup cans—all left for the king of Pop Art.\n\nA photographer inquired, “Dear Andy, How do you put models at ease?” A designer traveling all the way from Mexico confessed, “I’m your #1 fan and you are my inspiration.” Another visitor confided, “Sorry you can’t be friends on Facebook and Twitter. You would have loved that.”\n\n“My husband Matthew and I drove all the way from Miami, Florida, just to be here with you,” wrote Julie R. “You were an amazing artist and a truly weird person. Hope all is well down there, the world up here misses you.”\n\nMost only leave their first names. Some live within walking distance but others have come from as far away as the Czech Republic. And they’re an eclectic bunch, including one of Warhol’s classmates (a 90-year-old Bethel Park man who now lives within eyeshot of Andy), belly dancers, budding artists, adoring fans and haters alike, tourists, grade-schoolers, and entire families on a pilgrimage to visit someone they talk to like an old friend.\n\n“Hi Andy, I brought my two small daughters with me today to see where  you were buried because we’ve been discussing your art and they think it’s cool. My oldest—age 8—has been arranging soup cans all around the house. Hope you are doing well in the creative afterlife,” signed anonymous.\n\n“Today is my 18th birthday … I’m going to college to be a painter,” wrote Samantha Jo. “It’s the greatest feeling, right? Makes me feel so alive. Thanks for the inspiration.”\n\nAnd if writing Andy a message by hand is too 20th century for some gravesite guests, Roehrig also mans Figments: Conversations with Andy on Facebook and the Andy Warhol Hotline at412.508.9245. So far, Andy has received 22 calls.\n\n“I was just going to take a picture here every day,” she explains, motioning toward Andy’s tombstone, tucked away in the non-descript St. John Byzantine Catholic Cemetery at the corner of Route 88 and Connor Road, where Warhol was buried with his parents. “But as I did, I started noticing things showing up, gifts for Andy, and I realized other people came, too. And I wondered why. I wanted to know what they were thinking and what they were asking—what they wanted from Andy. I also wanted to capture it all without being invasive, but I didn’t know what to do. So I asked Andy.”\n\nRoehrig does a lot of that—asking Andy. Living only three miles from the gravesite, she’s been visiting Warhol infrequently since 2006, and now, for this project, every day for more than a year. She says she talks to him “Whenever I have a situation.” These “situations” are almost always of the creative kind, and Andy almost always delivers. “I believe Andy is listening,” says Roehrig, “that’s why it works. He helps me stretch my imagination.”\n\nIt all started when Roehrig, an education specialist at Carnegie Museum of Art, was stalled on an art installation she was developing for an exhibition at Seton Hill Uni­versity. Upon the anniversary of September 11, she started exploring terroristic images that enter people’s homes by way of their television sets. This conjured up Warhol’s famous Death and Disaster paintings, and off she went to sit and talk with Andy. Roehrig acknowledges that while this might seem odd to some, this kind of stream-of-consciousness thinking and quiet time at a cemetery isn’t so unusual for her, as she regularly visits and talks to her deceased parents and grandparents.\n\nNot long after talking it through with Andy, she decided that the best way to display the violent images she had captured from her television was to make time-based videos using the black-and-white images as a montage.\n\nIt’s a ritual that’s become a part of her artistic process, and her life. A private part of her life until her classmates at Vermont College of Fine Arts, where she completed her master’s degree last year, pointed out the fact that her connection to Andy is her artwork. So the documenting began: recording the handwritten notes and eventually videotaping willing visitors. (Beginning April 11, Roehrig will videotape gravesite visitors from noon-2 p.m. on the second Sunday of every month). And as her final graduate course project, Roehrig mounted an installation that included the notes, gifts, video, and a transportable tombstone marked “Figment.”\n\nWarhol died in 1987 at age 58 due to  complications following gallbladder surgery.  In America, his 1985 book of photographs, he said he wanted the word figment, not his name, on his tombstone. (He didn’t get his wish.)\n\nAnd now, in year two of  Conversations with Andy, Roehrig plans to take it all on the road to the place Warhol really considered home, New York City. With the help of Eric Shiner, The Warhol’s Milton Fine Curator of Art, she’s hoping to mount her installation in Union Square and a nearby gallery, allowing New Yorkers to talk to Andy at the mobile tombstone and read the messages left from admirers the world over. After all, one of Warhol’s studios, The Factory, once neighbored Union Square.\n\nWhat would Andy think about all this?\n\n“Andy completely loved attention, so I think this would make him quite happy,” says Shiner. “Andy still has a very strong influence on society and the fact that people, one way or the other, still want to communicate with him is really fantastic.”\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nI Just Want to Watch  ·  The Next 15  ·  Regenerative Medicine: A Growing Future  ·  Run, bounce, spin, climb and learn!  ·  President’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Face Time: Heather White  ·  Science & Nature: Our Super-sized World  ·  Artistic License  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

Two of them consider the impact of that encouragement at an early age.\n\nBy Julie Hannon\n\nZachary Hartle was 13 when he won a Carnegie Science Award for his “best of show” Pittsburgh Regional Science and Engineering Fair project, What Bridge Supports the Most Weight? Today, the 30-year-old architect with the Pittsburghbased design and manufacturing company TAKTL remembers the award ceremony like it was yesterday.\n\nHe had just received his very first digital camera, which in 1999 included a memory card with very limited capacity. “It could hold about 12 photos, and I used up all 12 in the first two minutes,” says Hartle, but thankfully not before posing with the guest speaker, the first African-American astronaut to fly in space, Guion S. Bluford, Jr.\n\nHartle recounts how he was seated among some of the biggest science and technology stars in western Pennsylvania, including a fellow award winner making conversation about his career analyzing human tissue. “I heard the word tissue and I thought he was asking me for a tissue, like a Kleenex,” recalls Hartle, laughing. “I was so embarrassed.”\n\nHe was also inspired. For a young man who grew up drawing houses, building with Legos, and admiring the beauty and functionality of bridges, the star-studded recognition ceremony at Carnegie Music Hall helped cement his career path. “I’ve always had an interest in architecture and engineering,” Hartle says, noting that his mother’s backgroundin architectural engineering played a role. “Winning the science fair in many ways helped reaffirm the suspicion I always had that not only was architecture my interest, but it could potentially be something I was good at. The Carnegie Science Award solidified it.”\n\nThe Science Center began recognizing regional achievements in science and technology just two years earlier, in 1997,by presenting six awards. This year, at its 20th annual Carnegie Science Awards celebration in May, the Science Center, through the support of sponsors such as Eaton, will present 20 awards. This increase highlights not only the growing talent of the region, but the commitment of the Science Center to be a leader in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and career development in the region.\n\n“It’s these kinds of awardees who are helping to build a future that promises to be healthier, smarter, and more prosperous for us all.”\n\n– RUPPERT RUSSONIELLO, PRESIDENT OF EATON’S CIRCUIT PROTECTION DIVISION\n\nOver the last two decades, the Science Center has recognized some 500 educators, students, entrepreneurs, environmentalists, innovators, technologists, and science communicators. This year, two new awards will honor excellence in the discovery and development of cleaner energy technologies in the region and leadership in educating students in technical and vocational subjects.\n\n“Over 20 years, Carnegie Science Awards have spotlighted some of the most innovative minds of the day,” says Ron Baillie, The Henry Buhl, Jr., Co-Director of Carnegie Science Center. “Collectively, the list of winners and their accomplishments is truly impressive. These individuals are making a global impact starting with our own region. We know that they’re inspiring a new generation of leaders.”\n\nCatherine Havasi, another 1999 student science fair winner, certainly fits this mold. “My science fair experiences were super important to me,” says Havasi. “It was a really great experience to meet a bunch of people who were really passionate about science in the same way I was. In some ways it made me go to MIT.”\n\nThe young computer programmer from Franklin Regional High School participated in three international science fairs, two as runner-up and one as the winner. It was her very first project that set her on the path to her wildly successful career in artificial intelligence. As a teenager interested in theater, Havasi wondered if she could use computers to control lighting for productions. So she picked up a book to learn about control systems. “The second half of the book was about artificial intelligence, and eventually I got bored and read the second half. It was either all uphill or downhill from there, depending on how you look at things,” says Havasi, laughing.\n\nLast year, she was named one of Fast Company’s most creative people for her work as CEO and co-founder of Luminoso, a 5-year-old analytics company and MIT Media Lab spinoff that teaches computers how to mimic human reasoning. The company takes natural language processing and artificial intelligence and applies it to customer feedback analytics. Consumer electronic companies are some of Luminoso’s best customers. When something goes wrong with a customer’s mobile phone, for example, that customer can log on to the manufacturer’s website and tell them why they’re unhappy with the product, providing a lot of useful data that’s not necessarily easy to sift through manually.\n\n“What our system does is Common Sense Reasoning—tries to understand people when they speak creatively,” explains Havasi. “As people, we use a lot of analogy and a lot of deductive reasoning to try and determine very quickly what someone means. And we’re really good at it. What we do at Luminoso is try and add that back into the computer. This allows companies to make better sense of their feedback and act quicker.”\n\nLuminoso also works with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) as it tries to predict where the flu is at any given time. The CDC receives a ton of “free text” feedback online. “We ask, well, what symptoms are these people having, can we tell from their tweets?” Havasi explains. “Who is actually sick, and who is just sick of Justin Bieber?”\n\nAt TAKTL, Hartle and team are using ultra high-performance concrete in wall assemblies to increase the performance and longevity of buildings, while also reducing resource consumption and energy usage. “The second most consumed substance in the world after water is concrete,” notes Hartle. “The third largest emitter of carbon is the production of cement. So if you can design a concrete that uses significantly less cement simply by using significantly less material—while also obtaining higher strength and greater performance— you can have a pretty big impact on the way people build buildings, and eventually on the carbon picture.”\n\nHartle and Havasi are the very reasons the Carnegie Science Awards matter, and why Eaton, a power management company, has stayed involved for more than a decade.\n\n“It’s these kinds of awardees who are helping to build a future that promises to be healthier, smarter, and more prosperous for us all,” says Ruppert Russoniello, president of Eaton’s circuit protection division and Carnegie Science Awards event chair. “Eaton is proud to be a part of this vibrant community of science leaders and educators who continue to help position our region among the foremost technology and energy innovation centers in the world.”\n\nCarnegie Science Awards are presented by Eaton. Chevron serves as the event’s prime sponsor. Award sponsors include Allegheny Health Network, Braskem, FedEx Ground, Kennametal Inc., NOVA Chemicals, Orionvega, Pittsburgh Business Times, and the Pittsburgh Technology Council.\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nMasters of the Mesozoic Sky  ·  The Art Revival of Mr. Chow  ·  Unseen  ·  What is Contemporary?  ·  President’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Face Time: Adil Mansoor  ·  Artistic License: The Museum as Laboratory  ·  First Person: Race Against Extinction  ·  Travel Log  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

For six months, the Air Force Lieutenant,\n\naeronautical engineer, and planetary scientist lived and\n\nworked with Russian Cosmonaut Gennady Padalka, serving as\n\nscientific head of the mission despite the fact that he’d\n\nnever been to space before. Fincke says he was scheduled\n\nfor a flight on the Space Shuttle first, but it was canceled\n\nafter the Columbia tragedy. “It was unusual\n\nfor me as a rookie to have the chance to go to the Space\n\nStation on my first mission.”\n\nThe rookie got his big break, and he’s savored every\n\nsecond of it. In fact, the one thing that surprised even\n\nMike Fincke about his six months in space was how much he\n\nreally loved it. “I wondered before I went if I’d\n\nreally enjoy it, especially for six months,” Fincke\n\nrecalls. “But I absolutely loved it! Just the wonder\n\nof looking at our planet from space…I never got tired\n\nof it.” And he has the photos to prove it—21,000\n\nin all.\n\nFincke began dreaming about space travel when he was 3\n\nyears old and “started seeing human beings walking\n\non the moon.” He watched every Apollo mission on television—and,\n\nhe says proudly, he had the advantage of living in Pittsburgh,\n\nwhere a young kid’s astronomical dreams could be well\n\nnurtured.\n\n“My parents fostered my interests by taking me to\n\nBuhl Planetarium,” Fincke says. “We’d\n\ngo there all the time…and then we started going to\n\nthe Natural History Museum, too.”\n\nFincke made a point of establishing ties with Carnegie Science\n\nCenter, home of the new Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium, after\n\nit opened in 1991. “I was really impressed,”\n\nhe says of his first visit in 1996. A few years later, on\n\na family visit to Pittsburgh, he called the Science Center\n\nand got a private tour. “I started a really good relationship\n\nwith the Science Center then, which I value.” Last\n\nyear, Fincke chose the Science Center as his one live downlink\n\nsite from space. More than 900 students gathered at the\n\nScience Center to participate.\n\n“A big part of our mission here at the Science Center\n\nis to motivate kids to be lifetime learners and explorers,”\n\nsays Jo Haas, the Henry Buhl, Jr., Director of Carnegie\n\nScience Center. “I can’t think of anything more\n\nmotivating than to interact with a man who has done exactly\n\nthat—lived out his dreams through the exploration\n\nof science and, ultimately, space. The downlink was really\n\na special event.\n\n“Mike has become such a good friend to Carnegie Science\n\nCenter,” Haas adds. “We’re looking forward\n\nto welcoming him back—this time, on the ground and\n\nnot via satellite—to speak at the 2005 Awards\n\nfor Excellence.”\n\nMike Fincke agrees that his life story is pretty inspiring.\n\n“That a guy from a blue-collar background like me\n\ncould dream of going to space and then grow up and actually\n\ndo it is an amazing thing,” he says\n\nNow that his life’s dream is fulfilled, what’s\n\na 37-year-old dreamer to do? “I’d love to go\n\nback and walk on the moon someday, or be part of a mission\n\nto Mars,” Fincke says. In the meantime, he’s\n\ncontent “changing diapers, trying my best to be a\n\ngood husband and a good father…and doing what I can\n\nto support my country and the space program, which I love\n\nto do.”\n\nAs he spreads the word about the space program, just don’t\n\nexpect him to talk about what it’s like having the\n\n“right stuff” to be a scientist in space. “Everyone\n\nhas a dream and certain skills,” he says. “What’s\n\nneat is that our country has the prosperity that allows\n\nus to pursue our passions. That’s what I did. But\n\nI still can’t play the piano worth a dime.”\n\nBack\n\n\\| Top\n\nHome \\| NewsWorthy \\| Now\n\nShowing \\| Face Time \\| About\n\nTown \\| Family Matters \\| Artistic\n\nLicense\n\nScience & Nature \\| Another\n\nLook \\| Travel Log \\| Then & Now\n\nCopyright\n\n(c) 2005 CARNEGIE Magazine.

Still today, every 3-4 years, the International brings the coolest, most interesting contemporary art in the world to Pittsburgh.\n\nLoading\n\n## Digging up Dippy\n\n### 1899\n\nAndrew Carnegie’s scientific sleuths had their marching orders: Find a dinosaur for Pittsburgh. And they did: an 84-foot saropaud, one of the largest creatures ever to walk the Earth and the first member of Carnegie Museums’ world-renowned collection of dinosaurs. They called him Diplodocus carnegii after his famous benefactor, and decades later someone nicknamed him “Dippy.” The name stuck, as did the Museum of Natural History’s reputation for being one of the best places in the world to see dinosaurs.\n\nLoading\n\n## Carnegie Museums’ First Big Expansion\n\n### 1907\n\nDippy needed a home and Andrew Carnegie had more bright ideas about what he’d like his museums to be. So he expanded his great monument in Pittsburgh, unveiling Dinosaur Hall, the Hall of Sculpture, and the Hall of Architecture, which Carnegie filled with the casts of some of the world’s great architectural wonders. Thankfully, a few decades later when most museums with architectural casts were tearing them down, Carnegie Museums bucked the trend—and today the great Hall of Architecture is one of only three such collections in the world. As for Dinosaur Hall, it’s history—literally. Its replacement, Dinosaurs in Their World, is scheduled to open in late 2007 and will be nearly three times the size of its predecessor.\n\nLoading\n\n## The Start of Saturday Art Classes\n\n### 1923\n\nAndy Warhol, photographer Duane Michels, and famed illustrator Burton Morris all hung out at Carnegie Museum of Art’s popular Saturday Art Classes, now called The Art Connection. Thousands of kids still come and get their Saturday art fix at the museum every year. And even if they don’t become famous artists, most of them never forget those days—gazing, and sketching, and exploring the world through art at their favorite art museum.\n\nLoading\n\n## Carnegie Magazine Hits the Presses\n\n### 1927\n\nThe precursor to today’s Carnegie magazine, the “Bulletin” of Carnegie Institute began informing and enlightening Carnegie Museums members towards the end of the roaring ‘20s. Today, the magazine reaches 33,000+ member households and thousands more friends and fans of Carnegie Museums.\n\nLoading\n\n## The Founding of the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science\n\n### 1939\n\nThe Buhl Planetarium on Pittsburgh’s North Side, a gift to the city from the Buhl Foundation, opened to the public this year and for decades after reined supreme as the definitive spot to study and dream about the stars. Ellmsworth native Mike Fincke did just that, and he grew up to be a scientist and astronaut on the International Space Station.\n\nLoading\n\n## Powdermill Nature Reserve is Born\n\n### 1956\n\nPowdermill was the dream of Dr. M. Graham Netting, former assistant director of Carnegie Museums of Natural History, who in 1948 outlined a plan to establish a natural-science field station somewhere in southwestern Pennsylvania. And its creation was the gift of General and Mrs. Richard K. Mellon and Mr. and Mrs. Alan M. Scaife, who in 1956 gave Carnegie Museums 1,160 acres of land near Ligonier, Pa. Named Powdermill Nature Reserve (after a stream that runs through it), it has since expanded to 2,200 acres of rich woodlands, streams, open fields, ponds, thickets, and plenty of wildlife; and its staff are renowned for their avian research programs as well their overarching efforts to teach everyone about the importance of conserving the environment.\n\nLoading\n\n## The Second Big Expansion: the Scaife Wing Opens in Oakland\n\n### 1974\n\nCarnegie Museum of Art finally gets its own beautiful space! The Sarah Scaife Galleries wing of Carnegie Museums’ Oakland facility opened this year, giving the museum’s constantly expanding collections of contemporary art, fine art, and decorative art their own elegant space.\n\nLoading\n\n## Opening of the Heinz Galleries and the Bruce Galleries\n\n### 1976\n\nCarnegie Museum of Art got even more room to grow when it opened its new changing gallery space, the Heinz Galleries, and its new home for its decorative art collection, the Bruce Galleries. The Heinz Galleries have since housed such renowned exhibitions as the Carnegie Internationals, Aluminum by Design, Light!, Luke Swank, and Fierce Friends\n\nLoading\n\n## Opening of Hillman Hall of Minerals & Gems\n\n### 1980\n\nThe Hillman Foundation and Carnegie Museum of Natural History shared a vision for a Natural History hall dedicated to the minerals that are part of our everyday lives. From iron and copper to diamonds and rubies. And in 1980 that vision became a reality. A showcase of 1,300 colorful minerals and gems from all over the world, the hall has since become a visitor favorite, and sometimes museum staffers measure the popularity of its exhibits by using the “fingerprint index” (i.e. the number of fingerprints left behind on the glass cases at the end of the day!).\n\nLoading\n\n## Polar World Open\n\n### 1980\n\nWelcome to the top of the world! When it opened in 1980, Polar World: Wyckoff Hall of Arctic Life was one of North America’s largest exhibits on the Canadian Inuit. And it still is. Guarding this Museum of Natural History hall is a gigantic polar bear, perfectly preserved and looking every bit the skillful hunter he is. A gift of the Wyckoff Family, the hall uses displays, dioramas, and videos to give the entire history and rich culture of the Inuit.\n\nLoading\n\n## Carnegie Institute becomes \"The Carnegie\"\n\n### 1986\n\nPittsburgh's largest and most far-reaching cultural organization became known as The Carnegie this year, at the time encompassing both Carnegie Museums and Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. To this day, the region still refers to Andrew Carnegie’s Pittsburgh museums as “The Carnegie.”\n\nLoading\n\n## Benedum Hall of Geology Opens\n\n### 1988\n\nThis Museum of Natural History exhibit hall has really rocked from day one—literally. The gift of the Benedum Foundation, the Benedum Hall of Geology is all about the rocks, minerals, fossils, and fossil fuels that make up this planet Earth. And the geology of Pennsylvania takes center stage.\n\nLoading\n\n## Opening of the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt\n\n### 1990\n\nCarnegie Museums boasted its share of Egyptian artifacts decades earlier, but it wasn’t until February 1990 that the Museum of Natural History opened a hall dedicated entirely to the majesty and mystery of ancient Egypt. The gift of the Walton Family, it featured more than 2,500 artifacts, some dating back to 3100 B.C.\n\nLoading\n\n## Carnegie Science Center Opens\n\n### 1991\n\nSince 1939, the Buhl Planetarium on Pittsburgh’s North Side was the city’s home to creative science learning. But in the late ‘80s, Carnegie Museums in collaboration with the Buhl Foundation picked a prime spot right along the Ohio River to be the site of a modern new science center and the new home of Buhl Planetarium. Since its 1991 opening, Carnegie Science Center has been welcoming more than half a million people a year for fun, interactive science experiences.\n\nLoading\n\n## Opening of the Hall of African Wildlife\n\n### 1993\n\nIt’s the next best thing to a safari, and it came to Pittsburgh this year. Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s Hall of African Wildlife gives museum visitors the closest view they’ll probably ever get of exotic animals from the African continent.\n\nLoading\n\n## Opening of the Heinz Architectural Center\n\n### 1993\n\nSince 1907, when Carnegie Museums unveiled its spectacular collection of architectural casts from some of the world’s great buildings, architecture has been a focus of the Museum of Art. But in 1993, through a gift of the Drue Heinz Foundation, the museum opened the Heinz Architectural Center and inaugurated a new era of architectural interest at Carnegie Museums. An impressive architectural creation itself, the Center is one of the most extensive facilities devoted to architecture in an American art museum.\n\nLoading\n\n## Opening of The Andy Warhol Museum\n\n### 1994\n\nAndy Warhol had sort of a love-hate relationship with his hometown. But there was only love in the air the night of the big, celebrity-heavy opening of The Andy Warhol Museum. It’s the most comprehensive single-artist museum in the world and the definitive place to go for everything Warhol. And it only made sense that the institution where Andy himself first studied art—Carnegie Museums—be the organization that brought Andy Warhol back to Pittsburgh.\n\nLoading\n\n## Carnegie Museums Celebrates a Centennial\n\n### 1995\n\nHow time flies…100 years and growing!\n\nLoading\n\n## Hall of North American Mammals Opens\n\n### 1995\n\nWhen it opened in 1995, the hall gave visitors a new appreciation for the museum’s skill in taxidermy. Mountain goats. Walruses. White-tailed deer. The endangered Jaguar. Even grizzly bears. Visitors see all this and more in the Museum of Natural History’s Hall of North American Mammals.\n\nLoading\n\n## Alcoa Foundation Hall of American Indians Opens\n\n### 1998\n\nA gift of the Alcoa Foundation, the Museum of Natural History’s Hall of American Indians is the only major museum exhibit focused on American Indians and their relationships with the natural world. Many artifacts featured in the hall were created by contemporary artists specifically for its exhibits, and all of the human figures featured in the real-life dioramas were made from casts of American Indians.\n\nLoading\n\n## The Opening of UPMC SportsWorks\n\n### 2001\n\nPittsburgh is home to three championship sports teams and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), one of the largest health organizations in the country. So why not merge the two into a learning experience everyone can appreciate? In 2001, Carnegie Science Center did just that by opening UPMC SportsWorks, the largest collection of sports and science exhibits anywhere. Kids of all ages enjoy figuring out the science behind such experiences as challenging Olympic sprinters to a race, rock climbing, and testing their baseball mettle at SportsWorks.\n\nLoading\n\n## Carnegie Museum of Art Acquires the Teenie Harris Archive\n\n### 2001\n\nCharles “Teenie” Harris was the longtime photographer for the _Pittsburgh Courier_, and his archive of more than 70,000 images is one of the most detailed records of the black urban experience known today.\n\nLoading\n\n## The Renovated Scaife Galleries Reopen\n\n### 2003\n\nAfter closing its Scaife Galleries for an 18-month renovation, Carnegie Museum of Art reopened them in 2003 to exuberant praise. In addition to making the necessary structural repairs and updates, the museum took the opportunity to re-hang its collections in newly painted spaces and, in some of the galleries, revisit the tradition of the salon-style hang (i.e. multiple paintings up and down a wall). The museum also brought out about 20% more art from its collections.\n\nLoading\n\n## Carnegie Science Center Wins IMLS Award\n\n### 2003\n\nIt’s the highest honor a museum can receive for educational outreach: the Annual Institutes of Museum and Library Service Award. Carnegie Science Center received this great honor in January 2003 at a White House ceremony hosted by First Lady Laura Bush.\n\nLoading\n\n## Dinosaurs in Their Time groundbreaking\n\n### 2004\n\nMany years in the planning, this Museum of Natural History project that’s going to change the way people see and learn about dinosaurs broke ground in the spring. And by the summer of 2005, most of Carnegie’s famous dinosaurs would be dismantled, bone by bone, and shipped off to be professionally cleaned, preserved, and reassembled in dynamic new poses for the 2007 opening of Dinosaurs in Their World. This new collection of dinosaur exhibits will be nearly three-times the size of the original Dinosaur Hall.\n\nLoading\n\n## The R.P. Simmons Family Gallery Established\n\n### 2006\n\nIn 2005 Carnegie Museum of Natural opened its new climate-controlled third-floor gallery for changing exhibits. And in 2006, Pittsburgh businessman Richard P. Simmons made the decision to support the museum’s efforts to bring exciting exhibits to Pittsburgh. The hall was renamed at a special ceremony, in honor of the Simmons family, and the Simmons gift will help bring exciting new changing exhibits to Pittsburgh for years to come.\n\nLoading\n\n## Buhl Planetarium Creates the Buhl Digital Dome\n\n### 2006\n\nLess than 10 percent of the planetariums in the world are equipped with the latest full-dome, digital technology called DigitialSky, and in the fall of 2006 the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium at Carnegie Science Center become one of them. Now called the Buhl Digital Dome, the Planetarium’s theater can now take visitors to the far reaches of many galaxies—in real-time—using images captured by NASA’s unmanned satellites.\n\nLoading\n\n## _Building the Future Campaign_ a Success\n\n### 2008\n\nThanks to the contributions of more than 6,900 individuals and organizations, Carnegie Museums ended its successful _Building the Future_ campaign with $161 million raised—$11 million above goal. Among its projects, the campaign funded _Dinosaurs in Their Time_, expansions of Powdermill and the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems, the Buhl Digital Dome, and the Center for Museum Education.\n\nLoading\n\n## _T. rex_ Returns\n\n### 2008\n\nThe climactic finale of _Dinosaurs in Their Time_ features Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s original _T. rex_ in a bitter showdown with a fierce new nemesis, a second _T. rex_, nicknamed “Peck’s Rex.”\n\nLoading\n\n## Opening of _roboworld_ ™\n\n### 2009\n\nCarnegie Science Center opens the world’s largest permanent robotics exhibit featuring more than 30 interactive displays honoring, explaining, demonstrating, and questioning the ever-fascinating robot, in its many incarnations.

Hillman Foundation, The Pop District features public art installations, workforce development programs, and a creative arts center at the intersection of Sandusky and East General Robinson streets.\n\nLoading\n\n## Carnegie Music Hall Gets a Facelift\n\n### 2024\n\nThe most substantial renovation in the music hall’s 128-year history added critical updates such as new wiring and climate control, cosmetic refreshes, and improved accessibility through custom-designed wider seats and aisles with slopes replacing steps. Carnegie Museum of Art conservators guided painters in matching antique and modern paints and using cotton swabs and vinegar to clean decorative panels. Scores of workers re-plastered, repainted, and cleaned gold leaf all the way up to the ceiling fleurs-de-lis.\n\nLoading\n\n## The Warhol’s 30th Anniversary\n\n### 2024\n\nThe Warhol celebrates its third decade with a darkly comic exhibition that paired its namesake artist with the Brooklyn-based artist KAWS.\n\nLoading\n\n## Science Center receives a historic $65 million gift\n\n### 2024\n\nThe gift from longtime supporters Daniel and Carole Kamin represents the largest since Andrew Carnegie’s original gift creating the institution. The financial support will go toward expanding programming and exhibitions and put the museum at the leading edge of its field. In recognition of the Kamins’ generous offering, the Science Center is renamed the Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center.\n\nLoading\n\n## Kamins make $25 million gift to Carnegie Museum of Natural History\n\n### 2025\n\nDaniel and Carole Kamin made another historic gift to Carnegie Museums: $25 million to the Museum of Natural History to update its largest exhibition and support its scientific mission for generations to come. A portion of the money will be used to renovate the museum’s Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibition, which opened in 2007, and the gallery that houses the exhibition will be renamed the Daniel G. and Carole L.

Andrew Carnegie called the grand building—which included Carnegie Music Hall and Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh—his “monument,” and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life.\n\nA year later, Carnegie Museums held the first [_Carnegie International_](https://carnegieart.org/art/carnegie-international/), second only to the Venice Biennale as the world’s oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museum’s collection of art quickly grew as a result.\n\n![Old photo of a group of people at The first Carnegie International, 1896.](https://carnegiemuseums.org/wp-content/uploads/history_intl_1896-1024x644.jpg)The first _Carnegie International_, 1896.\n\nTwo years later, in response to news that the bones of “colossal” prehistoric creatures were being found out west, Carnegie sent a scientific crew to Wyoming, where they would discover the first of many world-famous dinosaurs.\n\nTo make room for the display of his namesake, [_Diplodocus carnegii_,](https://carnegiemnh.org/explore/dinosaurs-in-their-time/) in 1904 Andrew Carnegie broke ground on Carnegie Museums’ first major expansion. While the most famous product of that growth was the great Dinosaur Hall, its neighboring hall, the [Hall of Architecture](https://carnegieart.org/art/art-around-you/hall-of-architecture/), best embodied Andrew Carnegie’s desire to “bring the world” to the people of Pittsburgh.\n\n### **Becoming the four Carnegie Museums**\n\nCarnegie Museums’ second most ambitious period of growth began in 1974, with the opening of the Sarah Scaife Galleries, which gave Carnegie Museum of Art’s constantly growing collections their own elegant space. Between 1980 and 1993, Carnegie Museum of Natural History [added a number of new exhibit halls](https://carnegiemnh.org/visitor/exhibitions/): Hillman Hall of Minerals & Gems, Polar World, the Benedum Hall of Geology, the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, and the Hall of African Wildlife.\n\nIn 1986, the expanding cultural powerhouse became known as “The Carnegie,” and, to this day, many in the region still refer to Andrew Carnegie’s Pittsburgh museums as The Carnegie.\n\nIn 1991, [Carnegie Science Center](http://carnegiesciencecenter.org/) entered the Carnegie Museums fold through a partnership between Carnegie Museums and the Buhl Foundation. The Science Center is home to [Buhl Planetarium](http://carnegiesciencecenter.org/planetarium/), the [Miniature Railroad & Village](http://carnegiesciencecenter.org/exhibits/miniature-railroad/), and hundreds of interactive science exhibits.\n\nThree years later, in 1994, Carnegie Museums again brought something new and irreplaceable to Pittsburgh, and the world: [The Andy Warhol Museum](https://www.warhol.org/), the most comprehensive single-artist museum in the world, illuminating the art and life of one of the most influential American artists of the 20th century and serving as a global ambassador to Pittsburgh’s cultural richness and diversity.", "source_category": "music_culture", "source_root_url": "https://carnegiemuseums.org/", "format": "HTML", "is_pdf": false, "scraped_at": "2025-10-05T03:23:34.332641", "metadata": {"original_content_length": 30397, "cleaned_content_length": 28779, "word_count": 4408, "char_count": 28779, "description": "TimelineJS Embed"}}

To his amazement, he lands the stunt on two feet and in one piece.\n\nSeifried, 76, would have never strapped himself into a bungee harness at an exhibit called Bounce at Carnegie Science Center’s Highmark SportsWorks® had it been crawling with kids the way it usually is. But this is a 21+Night, and Seifried and more than 250 other adults have the run of the place during the no-kids evening, the first of 10 to be held this year.\n\n“This is great,” says Seifried, a McKees Rocks resident, flashing a big grin. “There are no kids around and you don’t embarrass yourself as much. We’re going to do everything.”\n\nWith Pittsburgh’s skyline and rivers flickering in the distance—and visitors hula hooping to music, screaming inside a roller coaster simulator, and sipping beers as they marvel at robots—Carnegie Science Center has been transformed into an adults-only playground. This January event is centered around the theme of sports, giving adults free reign not just inside the main building, but in Highmark SportsWorks, too.\n\n“When adults come to the Science Center, you hear so many times that they want to try things but they feel awkward pushing an 8-year-old out of the way to play with a robot,” says Jessica Lausch, director of visitor experience. “There are lines, and adults feel guilty making a kid wait longer to play.”\n\nFollowing the lead of adults-only events at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco and the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in Portland, Science Center staff piloted two adult-centered events last year. They were so popular—one Friday evening focused on the science of glass attracted some 900 people—that the museum decided to hold one a month in 2013, minus July and December. Each evening has a theme. February 7 focused on the science of love and candy. March 14—3.14—will celebrate Pi Day. “It’s a good geek day,” Lausch says. As part of the programming, staff will explain the mathematics and probability behind gambling (not to mention guests also receive a voucher for $15 in free slot and match play at nearby Rivers Casino).\n\nAt the January event, Amanda Budai, a 34-year-old social worker from Whitehall, tries something she hasn’t done since second grade: hula hooping. On the fourth floor’s Works Theater, she and others join the Steel City Hoop Union in keeping sparkly hula loops from falling as they swivel to the beat of Beyonce and other music. “It’s cool,” says Budai. “You see every kind of person—older people, people our age, younger people who were a little bit grungy, all with sparkly hula hoops.” She notes that it’s a totally different experience from when she brings her toddler son to the Science Center and just watches the kids play.\n\nInside Highmark SportsWorks, Budai ascends the climbing wall and jumps on the trampoline. Only the roller coaster simulator makes her feel nauseated, a common reaction from adults wobbling out of the exhibit. “It was a little rougher than I’m used to,” she says.\n\nOther exhibits are especially suited for adult frames. In YouYo, a person pulls down on a handle, which causes a wheel to roll, the momentum pulling them back up in the air. “People assume it’s for kids, but little kids often can’t do it right,” explains Zach Weber, a program presenter who helped plan the evening. “You need upper body strength to get to the top. It’s nice to see grownups take advantage of the exhibits. They’re not just for kids.”\n\nLiz Brindarova, a 26-year-old from Carrick, didn’t have much luck with YouYo. “I kind of flopped,” she admits. But she loves the roller coaster simulator, the climbing wall, and the whole idea of exploring a place that she used to come to as a kid. “This was the greatest idea ever,” she says. “It’s an affordable way to get out and do something different and be a kid again. I’m going to do everything!”\n\nPeople also sip drinks from the cash bar as they listen to the band, Dan Getkin and the Masters of American Music. Steely McBeam makes an appearance and volunteers from Bike Pittsburgh help visitors make buttons out of bike maps.\n\nAdults even spill over into the part of the Science Center usually filled with its youngest visitors. Instead of toddlers and kindergartners splashing in the water table and loading up the ball factory, grown men and women roll up their sleeves and play with the same sense of abandon. “They’re totally loving it,” observes Seifried.\n\nThe cost for the evening, which runs from 6 to 10 p.m., is $10 or $15 at the door, and guest get a $15 voucher to use at Rivers Casino, a sponsor of the events.\n\nAs for Seifried: The day after his romp through Highmark SportsWorks, his 76-year-old body ached. “I felt like I was in a fight,” he says with a laugh. But like any banged-up kid, he couldn’t wait to do it again, vowing to be at a future 21+Night. “I enjoyed every minute of it.”\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nUnder the Influence  ·  The Shape of Things  ·  Creatures of the Wild  ·  The Carving Out of a Collection  ·  Director’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Face Time: Nina Marie Barbuto  ·  Artistic License: Permantly Interesting  ·  Science & Nature: Survivor’s Tale  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

That’s big.”\n\n– John Wenzel, Director of Powdermill Nature Reserve\n\nTo clear or not to clear? Powdermill sets in motion a study of tornado-damaged forests.\n\nBy Julie Hannon\n\nWhen a tornado struck Ligonier in June of 2012, about 90 acres of trees were toppled on and near Powdermill Nature Reserve, the environmental research center of Carnegie Museum of Natural History. John Wenzel, director of the reserve, took a day or two by foot to survey the damage. Because it was extensive and followed a specific pattern, Wenzel got to thinking during his walk through the debris: This could be good.\n\nPitt graduate student Jake Slyder pauses at the edge of a harvested section of forest prior to setting up deer fences.\n\nGood, that is, for learning how wind-damaged forests rejuvenate. As it turns out, while there’s a long history of studying how forests respond to major wind disturbances like tornados, virtually no solid research exists about how clearing fallen timber afterwards impacts forest recovery in the eastern United States, says Wenzel, an entomologist who primarily studies social insects.\n\n“I realized this natural event was a rare opportunity to record rigorous experiments that could have broad implications on how we care for our forests,” says Wenzel. “That’s big.”\n\nHis first call was to Walter Carson, a biologist at the University of Pittsburgh who has been studying the forests of the eastern part of the country for 30 years. Carson and a team of collaborators recently wrapped up 14 years of research in the Allegheny National Forest demonstrating what the Bambi-loving public may find shocking: that white-tailed deer have a much greater negative impact on the health of a forest than deep shade or even fire.\n\n“Overbrowsing by deer often determines the pattern of forest rejuvenation in the east, and overbrowsing can cause biodiversity collapses,” says Carson. “They are that bad.”\n\nCarson jumped at Wenzel’s proposal of a partnership, knowing Powdermill is perfectly positioned for such a groundbreaking study for two big reasons. Unlike most other private landowners, the museum is willing to leave money on the ground, so to speak, forgoing revenue from logging in the name of science. And in 2008, the reserve conducted a landscape survey of its forests—which includes 45 species of trees—so researchers know the measurements of the forest prior to the wind damage, an incredibly helpful and highly unusual bonus.\n\n“Timber can be very valuable, so loggers and the Forestry Service see it as an important resource going to waste if you leave it on the ground,” says Carson. “The counterargument from ecologists is that downed logs contain vital nutrients for the soil; that salvaging trees and creating a flat landscape disturbs habitats for birds and other animals. Both schools of thought depend on your \\[college\\] degree. What is needed is good science to resolve debate.”\n\nAfter all, the country needs wood products, he says, and millions of acres of land is salvaged, or cleared of fallen timber, across the country each year. If science can help inform best practices, it would be a significant win-win.\n\nOne important question researchers want to answer is whether a salvaged or unsalvaged forest will lead to greater rejuvenation, and what species will grow back? When many trees are downed due to a tornado, the increased light at ground level can lead to the rapid growth of plants that would struggle under the shade of a forest’s canopy. But is it possible that timber left on the ground will inhibit such growth, physically obstructing its development? Or, could the difficulty of walking through an often dangerous, maze-like mess of fallen trees inhibit deer foraging, giving some plants more of a chance to survive where they would have had little or no chance in a cleared forest?\n\n“That’s what makes this study so unique and the most complete of its kind—that we’ll study the impact of deer browsing along with the impact of salvaging and the impact of the understory, all simultaneously,” Carson says.\n\nThe pair, in partnership with researchers from Ohio State, Penn State, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, University of Vermont, Virginia Tech, and Susquehanna University, expect to have initial findings within two or three years. But they plan to keep the experiment running for at least a decade in hopes that it will become a landmark location of forest recovery that’s reexamined for 50 years or more.\n\nJames Whitacre, the reserve’s GIS manager, gets a bird’s eye view to document the experiments.\n\nTo perform their experiments, the team will begin by using two 10-acre sections that are in close proximity to each other and of similar makeup—both important controls. Half of each will be salvaged. Equal parts of both the salvaged and unsalvaged areas will then be fitted with deer exclusion fences. And finally, in half of each deer-excluded area, the low-lying, deer-tolerant forest cover known as the understory will be removed, giving all plants across the test areas equal footing to grow. Then the team will replicate the experiments.\n\nWhat do they expect to find? “Our prediction is that the best way to provide a diverse, highquality forest decades after a blowdown is to salvage the timber, build fences to eliminate deer browsing, and remove the surviving understory when it sprouts again,” Wenzel says.\n\nBut whatever the findings, he notes, they’ll inform how we responsibility care for our forests. Putting into perspective just how much this matters: There were more trees blown down by Hurricane Katrina in just the state of Mississippi than the entire United States cut down for any reason in 1995, the year of that devastating storm.\n\n“We’ll tease out the major factors,” says Carson. “You have to be willing to do the big experiments and do them correctly. And it takes a unique place like Powdermill to make this thing run.”\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nUnraveling Race  ·  Silver & Suede  ·  The Tedious Intrigue of Art Conservation  ·  Sun Struck  ·  President’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Face Time: Nicholas Chambers  ·  Artistic License: The Science of Sculpture  ·  Science & Nature: Nature as Classroom  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

She whips around her enormous tail, and using her powerful jaws steals a fish right under the nose of Dr. Dino, her human handler. The kids in the auditorium burst into laughter.\n\n“Spiny, Spiny,” Dr. Dino scolds the hulking Spinosaurus, a ferocious meat-eater that, as it turns out, not only towered over T. rex but is the first known dinosaur built to swim, explaining her penchant for fish. “You’ll get more treats later. I think she’s getting bored. When she gets bored, she likes to hear a nice, loud roar.”\n\n“When I was a kid, I became fascinated by Spinosaurus. It’s so cool to me that our show is introducing a new generation to this amazing dinosaur and the world it lived in.”\n\n– MATT LAMANNA, CARNEGIE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY PALEONTOLOGIST\n\nDr. Dino leads the cheer, “Dear Spiny, you are the fiercest predator in all the land.” And soon the children and parents seated inside Gateway Middle School in Monroeville are shouting out to the mighty Spinosaurus in unison.\n\nThe fun-loving crowd has a front-row seat for Spinosaurus Encounter!, the new headliner in Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s Natural History on the Move program, a sciencemeets- entertainment show that travels to community centers, libraries, and schools around the region, as well as Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe human legs poking out of the latex costume notwithstanding, the kids suspend disbelief as they watch the life-size juvenile Spinosaurus bring its ancient ecosystem to life in a science-themed assembly, this one sponsored by Monroeville Public Library.\n\nThough she stands about 10 feet tall and measures 15 feet long, with a sail protruding from her hulking back, Spiny has a playful streak. That’s because she was built as a 6-year-old youngster.\n\nSpiny is played with prehistoric panache by Kalie Tomiczek, one of the four handlers of the wearable puppet. By sticking her feet in Spiny’s feet and using bicycle handles to maneuver the mouth and eyes, Tomiczek stomps like a young dinosaur.\n\n“She looks pretty good for a 95-millionyear- old gal,” says Dr. Dino, who is played by Joe Connelly. He then enlists a few volunteers to come up to the stage and play hide-andseek with Spiny.\n\nThe kids count, “One-Spinosaurus, two- Spinosaurus, three-Spinosaurus,” as the star of the show hides behind the curtain. A little boy squeals as he runs across the stage and points to one big feature.\n\n“Spiny, your tail gave you away again,” Dr. Dino reports. “She never knows what to do with that tail.”\n\nDespite this playfulness, the Spinosaurus Encounter! is big on pint-sized science, a trademark of Natural History on the Move. With the basic philosophy that “anyone can learn science,” Natural History on the Move reaches nearly 18,000 people a year, says Pam Brutsche Keiper, outreach program manager. Spiny, for example, stomps on the stages at Idlewild and Kennywood parks, bringing natural history lessons to the masses.\n\nWhat audiences react to is a dinosaur costume made with the scientific know-how of Matt Lamanna, paleontologist and Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s very own dinosaur hunter.\n\nLamanna explains that Spinosaurus first gained notoriety a century ago when a German scientist unearthed its fossils in Egypt. But the ancient remains were destroyed in an Allied bombing of Munich in 1944, leaving researchers without its fossil record until the recent discovery of new Spinosaurus bones—including a partial skeleton—in Morocco.\n\nWhile it’s true that Spinosaurus is now the largest known predatory dinosaur—at least eight feet longer than the biggest known T. rex—its size isn’t its only defining feature. What did it say about Spinosaurus, Dr. Dino asks the audience, that various aspects of its body were similar to those of a crocodile, a whale, and a crane? The startling conclusion: Spinosaurus must have lived at least partially in water, making it the first known semi-aquatic dinosaur.\n\nLamanna—who was a consulting expert on several national TV specials about Spinosaurus—weighed in on the museum’s purchase of the Spinosaurus costume for its Natural History on the Move show. “The first one was clearly based on the Spinosaurus in the Jurassic Park III movie, which is pretty inaccurate,” he recalls. So he asked the designers to make changes, ensuring Spiny would be “scientifically legit.”\n\nIn fact, every last detail of the show—down to the kinds of plants used in materials to advertise the assembly—were well researched.\n\nWhile Lamanna calls the new design “waaaay better and certainly more accurate” than the Hollywood-based costume, the designers couldn’t accommodate every single change.\n\n“Based on the most recent fossil discoveries from Morocco, the hand claws of Spinosaurus were probably almost straight rather than strongly curved,” Lamanna explains. Down the road, an artist may make that tweak along with minor modifications to the animal’s hind feet.\n\nBack in the auditorium, Dr. Dino calls a handful of kids onto the stage, hands them field vests, and addresses them as doctor as he teaches them about an environment that Spiny once inhabited—the Bahariya Oasis in Egypt’s Sahara Desert. It’s a location the museum’s dinosaur hunter knows well, Dr. Dino points out, having prospected there on and off for the last 15 years. While Lamanna and his collaborators have only discovered bits and pieces of Spinosaurus, they did unearth a completely new and gigantic dinosaur species, Paralititan, during their first expedition to the location in 2000.\n\nThe kids approach the show’s backdrop of layers of rock, removing sections until they uncover lifelike replicas of a skull bone of a giant fish and a fossil crab—items Lamanna himself found in the ancient ocean where Spiny, believed to be an adept swimmer, once lived.\n\nDr. Dino comes up with a catchy chant to explain stratigraphy, the study of rock layers and their ages. “New on top. Old on bottom,” he says, explaining that the older fossils are buried deeper within the earth.\n\nHe also gives the wide-eyed kids a reason not to pet a dinosaur.\n\n“She almost bit you,” he warns one young volunteer. “Do you have your fingers and toes? You have to watch her every second or she eats everything.”\n\nBut this does anything but scare away a crowd filled with spirited dinosaur enthusiasts. With a little prompting from their parents, Jonathon Eisenman, 8, and his friend, Jay Sen, 7, laugh together after the show, reciting the chant they learned about a new word, stratigraphy. “New on top and old on bottom.” The kids share a sense of wonder not lost on Lamanna. “When I was a kid, I became fascinated by Spinosaurus,” he says. “It’s so cool to me that our show is introducing a new generation to this amazing dinosaur and the world it lived in. Who knows, maybe one of these kids will grow up to be the person who answers the many questions we still have about Spinosaurus.”\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nBook Smart  ·  Imperfectly Modern  ·  Divine Provenance  ·  The Fab (Lab) Life  ·  President’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Face Time: Steve Tonsor  ·  Artistic License: Drawing Hopper  ·  First Person  ·  Travel Log  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

When the Westinghouse Electric Company’s “atom smasher” first took up residence in Forest Hills, just east of Pittsburgh, in the summer of 1937, the silver light-bulb-shaped structure was seen as a beacon of progress.  A true reflection of humankind’s boundless quest for knowledge.\n\nPhoto: Detre Library & Archives at the Heinz History Center\n\nIn development two years before nuclear fission—the ability to split the atom to generate power—was discovered, the 5-million-volt Van de Graaff nuclear accelerator, then the largest of its type, was a pioneering laboratory for one of the world’s first large-scale nuclear physics research programs. It was a cousin to Van de Graaff generators, those shiny silver balls that make kids’ hair stand on end, and it gave Westinghouse scientists the power to shoot a beam of high-energy particles at a speed of 50 million miles per hour at target atoms and observe the results. Research performed there led to the photo-fission of uranium, an important step in the process of generating nuclear power. Surprising work, perhaps, in 1930s Pittsburgh. But according to Anne Madarasz of the Senator John Heinz History Center, which houses Westinghouse’s archives, the flashy piece of history-making equipment was emblematic of Westinghouse’s core belief. “The company never stopped thinking about the future,” the History Center’s chief historian asserts, “even in the midst of the Great Depression.” As the story goes, Westinghouse executives entered the field of nuclear physics with high hopes that it would generate promising new research, attract scientific talent, and improve its public image on the heels of Depression-era furloughs. But the future long ago left the last remaining relic of Westinghouse Research Laboratories behind. Despite its many claims to fame, the atom smasher has been sitting idle not far from Ardmore Boulevard for nearly 60 years.\n\n“It really is a singular artifact that represents the origin of everything Westinghouse went on to do in nuclear power.”\n\n– Marni Blake Walter, an archaeologist specializing in historical and cultural resource management\n\nLast winter, P&L Investments LLC, the current owner of the 11-acre site where the atom smasher and former research center once stood, began clearing the way for new construction. In a move that surprised and angered its neighbors, despite promises to restore the vestige, it was toppled and left unceremoniously languishing on its side. Where, at least for the moment, it remains. While in the real world the atom smasher’s fate remains decidedly uncertain, inside Carnegie Science Center’s Miniature Railroad & Village® it has once again found its footing.In November, the piece of Pittsburgh’s atomic past joined other retired regional landmarks to be immortalized in miniature, including the original Allegheny Observatory, Forbes Field, Klavon’s Pharmacy, the Sharon Steel Mill, and the Crawford Grill. As far as Patty Everly is concerned, the timing could not be better. “The atom smasher has been in the news lately,” says Everly, the Science Center’s curator of historic exhibits, “and no one knows if we’ll ever see it standing again.”A big part of Everly’s job involves painstakingly creating scale models of the historically, architecturally, or culturally significant sites that make up the Miniature Railroad & Village, which originated in 1920. Its animated scenes stretch back even further, illustrating how people in our region lived, worked, and played up to 1940. The addition of the atom smasher—a major feat of electric engineering—is a no-brainer. “It’s an iconic symbol of Pittsburgh’s industrial past,” says Everly. Drawing inspiration from photographs, archival records, and memories of community members, Everly prepared the graphic design files necessary for a 3-D printer to produce a liquid resin replica of the generator’s signature pear shape. Even though Paul Rand’s famous Westinghouse “W” logo wasn’t added to the side of the towering  laboratory until after its prime, it’s included on the Science Center’s replica along with the buff-brick building that once surrounded it.“I grew up within a half-mile of the atom smasher,” says Marni Blake Walter, an archaeologist specializing in historical and cultural resource management. “It was a fixture in my life.” Walter’s grandparents worked at Westinghouse, and her dad attended the company’s technical night school and became an engineer. Although the 45-year-old Walter and her family settled in the Boston area, her mother and aunt still live in Forest Hills.“I remember after I went to college and I would bring friends home to visit,” she says, “they would always ask, ‘What is that?’ And I thought, ‘Wait a minute, I guess this is pretty unique.” Today, people might think of the artifact as   a quirky roadside attraction, but in the 1930s, Madarasz says, “it was incredibly futuristic and modern looking.” Despite being nestled among residential homes, the atom smasher didn’t inspire fear but rather a sense of pride. That’s largely because its neighbors knew and trusted Westinghouse, the company that brought electric lights, radio, and televisions into their homes. It was also Westinghouse that essentially built Forest Hills and neighboring Chalfant and East Pittsburgh. Forest Hills, specifically, was a planned community, a company town whose residents were dependent on the industrial behemoth to make a living and support their families. So when L.W. Chubb, the research facility’s director, opted to green light the atom smasher project, the announcement was met with enthusiasm and unbridled optimism. As part of a media blitz promoting its innovation, Westinghouse hosted community days and invited residents and press to visit the site.On July 7, 1937, the Pittsburgh Sun Telegraph practically gushed, “The world’s first atom-smashing ‘cannon’ is nearing completion in East Pittsburgh. The huge apparatus, resembling a stratosphere balloon, will be used for an inconceivable possibly epic-making venture into the infinities of pure research.”Life magazine published its own four-page spread, heralding, “Mightiest atom smasher at East Pittsburgh, PA: Biggest machine for investigating the smallest particles of matter is this 65-ft. atom smasher.” But in just a few years, everything changed. Entering World War II, the U.S. government sought to consolidate nuclear research around the top-secret Manhattan Project. Westinghouse shut down the atom smasher and shifted its focus to defense, developing some of the earliest jet engine prototypes, microwave technology for radar, and gyroscopic controls for military tanks.After the U.S. dropped bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the public view of nuclear power changed. The atom smasher did make a short-lived comeback, but by 1958 it was officially retired. Westinghouse’s contributions to nuclear research have been far more long lasting. The company was instrumental in developing the first nuclear submarine, the USS Nautilus, and the first commercial nuclear power station in Shippingport, Pennsylvania. Today, nearly half of all commercial nuclear power plants in operation were either built or designed by Westinghouse engineers. Despite receiving various accolades, including being designated historically significant by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundations in 2000, the atom smasher has no legal standing.“My belief is that the atom smasher should be repaired and put back in its original place—not as an impediment to progress, but as an integral, valuable part of the future,” Walter writes in her atomic heritage-inspired blog, Atomic Confluence.“It really is a singular artifact that represents the origin of everything Westinghouse went on to do in nuclear power.”\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nHead-to-toe Science  ·  Art as an Equalizer  ·  Earth in the Age of Humans  ·  Strength in Numbers  ·  President’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Face Time: Jeffrey Inscho  ·  Science & Nature: Lion Attacking a Dromedary  ·  Artistic License: New Voices of Appalachia  ·  Travel Log  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

And in middle school, they start getting sucked into some bad decisions in the street.”\n\nA new after-school enrichment program run by the Girls, Math & Science Partnership at Carnegie Science Center aims to help students like Horsley overcome the odds of their circumstances and nurture their interest in math and science. The program—called Girls Engaging in Math and Science (GEMS)—kicked off this past October with “Get Your Game On,” a series of 10 weekly sessions where nearly 30 middle-school girls work towards designing their own board games.\n\n“Many girls, often starting around grade six, view math and science as ‘hard’ and opt out of advanced classes, cutting themselves off from future opportunities in college and the workplace,” says Ann Metzger, the Science Center’s Henry Buhl, Jr., Co-Director. The partnership seeks to excite and inspire girls to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math—the critical “STEM” fields—as part of the new Chevron Center for STEM Education and Career Develop-ment at the Science Center. “Women are still seriously underrepresented in many STEM fields, especially engineering and the computer sciences,” adds Co-Director Ron Baillie.\n\nDisparities in STEM achievement between boys and girls can be even more pronounced at low-income schools like Pittsburgh King, where just 42 percent of eighth-graders in 2010 scored proficient or higher on state math exams. Funded by the Alcoa Foundation, the GEMS program is helping to close the gender gap at Pittsburgh King by introducing girls there to the fundamentals—and fun—of “board game science.”\n\n“You might not realize it, but when you play a board game, you are actually demonstrating mathematical principles,” says Zachary Koopmans, program development coordinator for the Girls, Math & Science Partnership. “Take Monopoly, where if you roll doubles three times in a row, you go to jail. But the probability of throwing three consecutive doubles is one in 216. That catastrophic occurrence is very rare, and it’s specifically designed that way.”\n\nTo formulate the rules of their own board games, Horsley and the other GEMS participants learn about probability, statistics, and other math concepts, as well as hone their strategy development and problem-solving skills. The math lessons taught by Koopmans and a team of Carnegie Science Center educators and community volunteers are couched in hands-on fun.\n\nCarol Goldburg, director of the undergraduate economics program at Carnegie Mellon University, led a recent session to introduce the girls to classic games in experiential economics, encouraging them to consider the strategic interactions among players. In one exercise involving the “dictator game,” the students had to divvy up a fixed amount of M&Ms between themselves and a partner, pretending the other person was either a stranger or their best friend. Thirteen-year-old Melvay Solomon gave eight of her 10 candies to her “best friend” Eyleen Bermu~dez. Yet she shared only a couple of M&Ms with Bermu~dez the stranger.\n\nThe task is meant to encourage the girls to think beyond zero-sum games. “This was more interesting to play than say, Monopoly, where the only outcome is you might win or lose,” Koopmans explains to the group. “Here, you got to decide what winning means, not some rule book or piece of paper.”\n\n“The kids are so used to thinking that math means numbers and tables and solving equations with a pencil on paper,” adds Mancuso. “This interactive program really lets them see that math is used in a lot of different careers, and that the skills they are learning in the classroom are actually at play in a lot of places.”\n\nGEMS is based on the similarly named GEM program, which stands for Gaining Equity Through Mathematics. Funded by the U.S. Department of Education, GEM brought more than 70 high-school girls from Pittsburgh Public Schools to the Science Center over the last two years for monthly “power” sessions led by math- and science-loving female mentors. In one gathering, the students learned how to use audio software to record and edit their own cell phone ringtones. Another month they rewired electronic toys to power them by hand-crank flashlights instead of batteries.\n\n“If the girls would’ve just read about these things, perhaps they would’ve thought, ‘I can’t do that—it’s too technical,’” says Bill Bowden, who teaches ninth grade pre-engineering at Pittsburgh Allderdice High School and accompanied a group of about 15 students to the GEM sessions. “But when they actually tried these activities and realized they could do them, it really boosted their confidence.”\n\nBowden and other teachers say their students also began to envision themselves in science and technology careers after meeting female professionals actually working in these fields. Then, suddenly, the $800,000, four-year program ended this past summer halfway through its proposed duration due to federal budget cuts. The Alcoa Foundation stepped up locally to provide support, asking the Science Center to try to replicate the early success it achieved through GEM with a smaller group of struggling middle-school girls at Pittsburgh King.\n\n“As a neighbor on the North Side, Alcoa-Pittsburgh is committed to educational and environmental programs that reach out to the next generation,” says Scott Hudson, principal manager, Alcoa Foundation. “GEMS is an innovative program that keeps girls interested in STEM-related education and careers as well as complements what is taking place in the classroom.”\n\nCome December, Horsley and the other GEMS participants will be expected to develop working board games and create business plans for how to produce and sell their games online—an added lesson in economic self-empowerment. If the experience helps to keep more of the girls in school and keep them interested and focused in math and science, Koopmans says he and his team will have done their job.\n\nAnd perhaps one day, Horsley will even get her shot at a veterinary career. Probability: Growing higher every day.\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nThe ABCs of Discovery  ·  Photographing My People  ·  International Negotiations  ·  The Art of Reading a Face  ·  Director’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Face Time: Linda Ortenzo  ·  Artistic License: Contemporary Craft  ·  The Big Picture\n\nCopyright © 2017 CARNEGIE\n\nMagazine.

My dad is 100% Kenyan and 100% awesome. My mom is a black-American and my hero!”\n\n– Joan Mukogosi, a junior at Winchester Thurston\n\nHow 20 high school students spent part of their summer doing what many adults probably wouldn’t dare—talk openly about race.\n\nBy Amy Whipple\n\nOn a large floor map of the world, 15-year-old Nova Fox plants her black sneakers on India. She’s petite but commanding of her audience of mostly peers, many of them strangers, gathered together inside RACE: Are We So Different?, an exhibition on view at Carnegie Museum of Natural History.\n\nTeens explore RACE: Are We So Different?\n\nPhotos: Amber Niedomys\n\n“My family started out in India,” she says, hopping west over the Middle East, landing squarely on Egypt. “They went on a pilgrimage,” she continues. “That’s how it started out that they got to Egypt and were enslaved and the word gypsy came about.” She inches her feet forward. “And then they went aaaaaaaall the way to Europe. Then racism started getting really bad and World War I is starting, so my family came to America.”\n\nShe looks across the Atlantic Ocean. “It’s just really cool,” she says with a pause, “to put it into perspective how far they actually went.”\n\nA sophomore at Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School in the Beaver County borough of Midland, Fox is one of 20 regional high school students who spent a chunk of their summer vacation helping to develop the museum’s Youth Summit on Race and Identity, an interactive program slated for October 22 that’s expected to draw dozens of area students and teachers. Museum educators initiated the idea of a program for teens by teens as a way to learn what’s important to young people about race and identity by getting them to talk to each other about it, something previous generations still haven’t mastered.\n\nRACE, a collaboration of the American Anthropological Association and the Science Museum of Minnesota, is billed as a conversation starter, and it’s gotten people talking, sharing, and educating each other in some 30 venues around the country.\n\n“Some people may lack the skills or the interest or the vocabulary or the courage to talk about race,” explains Cecile Shellman, communications specialist at the Museum of Natural History. “This exhibition really does invite people in overt and unconscious ways to talk about race.”\n\nPart of the museum’s challenge is to keep the conversation going long after the exhibition leaves Pittsburgh—and, ultimately, to affect measureable change in the community. Over the summer, with support from The Hive Fund for Connected Learning at The Sprout Fund, the museum teamed up with the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh, The Labs at Carnegie Libraries of Pittsburgh, Literary Arts Boom (a creative writing lab for Pittsburgh youth), and sister museum The Andy Warhol Museum to host a series of workshops designed to empower teens to develop content for the October summit that, combined with the exhibition, will hopefully have ripple effects.\n\nThe initial session gave the teens a chance to meet each other and consider some big ideas: what are the most important questions about race and identity for people your age; where do you think it’s most important to address racism; how and where do people learn racism; why a “race” exhibition; what influences your feelings and thoughts about racism; and, how can teens make a difference?\n\n“One of the big-picture goals of the summit is to engage a variety of different organizations in Pittsburgh that are doing this kind of work,” says Laurie Giarratani, assistant director of education at the Museum of Natural History. “The questions surrounding race are too big for the museum or the students to work through on their own.”\n\nIn the spirit of the exhibition, the workshops have encouraged students to think outside of the box. To employ methods comfortable to them—such as art-making, writing, and performance—to explore difficult topics. “One of the explicit goals is to be putting resources in the hands of teens to see where they want to take this conversation next,” says Giarratani.\n\nFor example, the group of students based at The Warhol and paired with Literary Arts Boom developed a visual guide to the exhibition in order to make its vastness less overwhelming. By using a fun, accessible format, such as trading cards or a ‘zine (small, inexpensively made magazine) they want to share supplemental information relevant specifically to Pittsburgh teens, such as a list of regional scholarships available for youth of color listed alongside exhibition content focused on economics.\n\nThough a section of the exhibition is devoted to education, some students wondered out loud if RACE’s larger focus was on adult audiences, noting the exhibition’s very adult issues of money, housing, and illness. It’s a reminder, they say, that their voices are frequently not considered valuable—the exact oversight the workshops and the summit seek to correct.\n\nThey did see themselves in the section of the show that highlights the Hapa Project, a multiracial identity art project created by American artist Kip Fulbeck. The Pittsburgh showing of RACE features 17 of the 1,200 minimalist portraits taken by the artist of individuals who self-identified as being of mixed ethnic heritage. After being photographed, participants chose their own terms to describe themselves, then responded to the question, “What are you?” in their own handwriting. The responses, some from children and teens, stopped many of the high schoolers in their tracks. Among their favorites: “My last boyfriend told me he liked me because of my race. So I dumped him.”\n\nThe teens embraced the exercise. Joan Mukogosi, a 16-year-old junior at Winchester Thurston, wrote, “I am an African-American. My dad is 100% Kenyan and 100% awesome. My mom is a black-American and my hero!”\n\nCarrie Mannino, 15, wrote, “I’m a writer— mostly a poet. I celebrate Christmas and Hanukah because I’m ‘half and half.’ I check white but I wish there were more options. If anyone asks, I say I’m an artist.”\n\nOthers identified themselves without mentioning race or ethnicity. Mollie March-Steinman, 17, a senior at Pittsburgh Creative and Performance Arts, sees herself as “a little too much. Too many opinions, too much talking, rambling, ranting, not enough doing or experiencing. I gotta step out of my comfort zone.”\n\nIt’s telling to note that each of the 20 teens chose to do just that, voluntarily spending part of their summer at the museum talking openly about very personal topics.\n\nMarch-Steinman, a writer like Mannino, who identifies as “100% vanilla,” adds, “I see adults skirt around \\[the topic of race\\] a lot. It’s like, just chill, everyone’s affected by it.” She says being white doesn’t excuse her from the discussion.\n\nAs head of her school’s Black Student Union, an afterschool club that frequently engages in discussions around race, Mukogosi says, “This just seems like the right place for me. I’m really excited to see how our work affects other students. Often in school, the people like us who are active don’t receive the amount of support that we want from our peers.

Aiken Elementary School gymnasium in Greentree, let out a collective gasp. Ranging in age from kindergarten to fifth grade, they’re engrossed in Wild Weather Adventure, a surprise-around-every-corner game designed and directed by Gawlas, a staff educator at Carnegie Science Center.\n\nMinutes earlier, Gawlas had divided the gym into two teams—the Hurricanes and the Tornados. At stake, a victory lap in a virtual balloon race around the world. With each correct answer, teams advance a space. But when the Hurricanes’ team captain spins the wheel, it lands on “Demonstration,” which is Gawlas’ cue to perform.\n\nAll eyes fix on her as she first presents some facts about lightning and then approaches a table covered with curious-looking equipment.\n\n“I have a lightning machine and it isn’t dangerous,” explains Gawlas, “but it makes the same kind of electricity that lightning makes—static electricity.” Then, she wields a silver wand toward a sputtering Van De Graff generator that produces high voltages of static electricity. As the wand nears the generator, a white electric bolt leaps from it with a crack.  “Ooooh,” the audience coos.\n\n“Now I want to show you how lightning travels,” Gawlas continues. “I need several victims, um, I mean volunteers.” Despite the hint of harm, nearly every hand shoots into the air. Gawlas selects six students and directs them to stand in a line and link pinky fingers. Gawlas stands on an orange milk crate so she isn’t grounded, and rolls up the sleeves of her red jacket.\n\n“When I am all charged up, I think you’ll be able to tell,” she muses. And as she rests her hand on the generator, her medium-length brown hair stands on end. Laughter erupts. She and Danny, the first boy in the line, touch elbows. A spark flies from her elbow to Danny’s. He jerks his arm away and soon every child in the line pulls away from the surprise of the shock.\n\n“I saw the lightning coming out of my elbow and it traveled through our bodies,” Gawlas explains. “Who knows what the pathway is in the body that allows the lightning to travel?”\n\n“Water!” shout the students.\n\nIt’s a typical weekday for Gawlas, who as an educator in the Science Center’s Science on the Road program, performs a science show in a different area elementary and middle school nearly every day in the fall. The Science Center reaches more than 170,000 children a year through the work of its outreach program.\n\nToday the show is all about weather. Yesterday it was about conserving the environment. Tomorrow the topic could focus on chemistry or the life sciences. Teachers at each school get to request the program they think will best supplement their own classroom learning.\n\n“We try to  provide a big wow factor in every show,” Gawlas explains. “We also try to show something that is too expensive for schools to buy themselves, and offer a different method for providing key information.”\n\nThe idea is to entertain and educate simultaneously by presenting information in a game-show format, as a mystery, or even as a version of musical chairs. The method works, as is obvious at Aiken Elementary: The kids can barely stay in their seats. They pump fists into the air, high-five one another, and cheer as if this were the Super Bowl, not a game about the science behind weather.\n\nAnd much like science, putting on a great assembly requires trial and error. After the Chain of Pain, Gawlas unveils the tornado cannon, a long metal tube that looks a lot like a flagpole.\n\n“This will show the power of a mid-range tornado,” she tells her captive audience. “A tornado can happen anywhere, at any time of day, but they are more likely to occur in Tornado Alley.”\n\nGawlas lays the cannon on the table and holds up a pencil before placing it in the tube. At the base of the pole, she slides a piece of wood about an inch-thick into a slot with a piece of metal resting behind it. She warns the students to cover their ears.\n\nShe hooks a hose to the top of the tube. Seconds later, the pencil shoots through the tube at 150 miles per hour and a loud t-h-w-a-c-k echoes through the gym. Gawlas strides over to the base of the cannon and picks up the wood. The pencil broke it in half.\n\nWhat the students don’t know is that it took Gawlas and the team at the Science Center’s fabrication shop many tries before the cannon was safe for schools. At first, the pencils flew erratically and the wood splintered, making dangerous projectiles. But that, too, is all part of the fun, says Gawlas. The fun of science.\n\n“It’s really hard to find a kid who doesn’t like science,” she says. “We try to bring science to an informal level for the kids, so they see that science is fun and that science is around us in the world every single day. These types of experiences engage and inspire young people. And who knows? Some of those kids in the audience may one day aspire to become scientists themselves.”\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nDarwins Big Bang: 150 Years Later  ·  Paging Doctor Darwin  ·  The Horse  ·  1958  ·  Director’s Note  ·  NewsWorthy  ·  Now Showing  ·  Face Time: Eric C.
