It previously was the home of the [Pittsburgh Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Power \"Pittsburgh Power\") of the [Arena Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_Football_League \"Arena Football League\") (AFL) from 2011 to 2014.\n\nConstruction was completed on August 1, 2010,[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-Architect_Predicts_Aug._1_Completion_of_Pittsburgh's_New_Arena-6) and the arena opened in time for the 2010–11 NHL season.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-lumps-7) It replaced the Penguins' former arena, [Civic Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Arena_(Pittsburgh) \"Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)\") (formerly known as Mellon Arena), which was completed in 1961. A ceremonial ground-breaking was held on August 14, 2008. The arena is the first [Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design \"Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design\") (LEED) gold-certified arena in both the NHL and AFL.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-Consol_Energy_Center_Is_First_NHL_Arena_To_Achieve_LEED_Gold_Certification-8) Soon after the arena opened in 2010 it was named \"Best New Major Concert Venue\" in the [Pollstar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollstar \"Pollstar\") Concert Industry Awards and \"Best NHL Arena\" in the _Sports Business Journal_ reader poll.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-Consol_Energy_Center_Wins_Award-9)[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-10) The arena was originally named **Consol Energy Center** ( **CEC**) after [Consol Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consol_Energy \"Consol Energy\") purchased the naming rights in December 2008.

The Penguins were granted the license, though the decision of which casino company would receive approval was the Gaming Control Board's decision.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-NoBrain-14) The Lemieux Group reached an agreement with [Isle of Capri Casinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Capri_Casinos \"Isle of Capri Casinos\"), which offered to fully fund a US$290 million arena, if Capri could also construct a $500 million casino nearby.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-NoBrain-14) Other casinos, including [Majestic Star Casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Majestic_Star_Casino,_LLC \"The Majestic Star Casino, LLC\") and [Forest City Enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_City_Enterprises \"Forest City Enterprises\"), also agreed to partially contribute to the arena's funding.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-PITG_Wins_Slots_Casino_License_for_North_Side-15) On December 20, 2006, the Gaming Control Board awarded the license to Majestic Star Casino, who agreed to pay $7.5 million for the first 30 years,[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-Analysts:_Isle_of_Capri_Favored_to_Win-16) in addition to the Penguins paying $4 million per year.[\\[17\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-Pa._Gaming_Board_Awards_5_Slots_Licenses_in_Historic_Session-17)[\\[18\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-ToBreak-18) The casino experienced financial difficulty, which could have led to taxpayers financing the entire project. However, on August 14, 2008, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board selected [Neil Bluhm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Bluhm \"Neil Bluhm\") to take ownership of the casinos, which pulled the casinos out of risk of bankruptcy.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-Casino_Project_Back_on_Track-19) The casino, now known as the [Rivers Casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_Casino_(Pittsburgh) \"Rivers Casino (Pittsburgh)\"), eventually opened on August 9, 2009, in the North Side [Chateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_(Pittsburgh) \"Chateau (Pittsburgh)\") neighborhood.\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Consol_Construction_July_2009.jpg/250px-Consol_Construction_July_2009.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Consol_Construction_July_2009.jpg) The arena in July 2009\n\nThe arena's funding plan was agreed upon by Lemieux, Pittsburgh mayor [Luke Ravenstahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Ravenstahl \"Luke Ravenstahl\"), and Pennsylvania governor [Ed Rendell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Rendell \"Ed Rendell\") on March 13, 2007, after much negotiation.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-dealkeep-20) During negotiations, the Penguins explored moving the franchise to [Kansas City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri \"Kansas City, Missouri\") or [Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas \"Las Vegas\") (the latter of which [received an NHL expansion team in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights \"Vegas Golden Knights\")); after the deal was made the Penguins agreed to stay in Pittsburgh for at least 30 more years.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-dealkeep-20) Lemieux later stated that relocating the franchise was never a possibility, but instead it was a negotiation tactic to help the team get funding for the arena from both state and local officials.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena#cite_note-Countdown_to_2010;_Arena_Construction_Begins-21) The arena was originally scheduled to open for the 2009–10 NHL season;

(Coca-Cola previously held the contract with Civic Arena.) Instead, [Dr Pepper Snapple Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Pepper_Snapple_Group \"Dr Pepper Snapple Group\") holds a contract, and serves its own products such as [RC Cola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_Cola \"RC Cola\"), [Diet Rite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_Rite \"Diet Rite\"), [Cherikee Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherikee_Red \"Cherikee Red\"), and [Sunkist Orange Soda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunkist_(soft_drink) \"Sunkist (soft drink)\"), in addition to its more popular brands such as [Dr Pepper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Pepper \"Dr Pepper\"), [7 Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Up \"7 Up\"), and [A&W Root Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%26W_Root_Beer \"A&W Root Beer\") that are typically sold alongside [Coca-Cola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola \"Coca-Cola\") or [Pepsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi \"Pepsi\") products in other venues.
