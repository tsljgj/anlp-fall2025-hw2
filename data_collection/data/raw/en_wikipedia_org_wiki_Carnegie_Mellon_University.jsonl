The institution was established in 1900 by [Andrew Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie \"Andrew Carnegie\") as the **Carnegie Technical Schools**. In 1912, it became the **Carnegie Institute of Technology** and began granting four-year degrees. In 1967, it became Carnegie Mellon University through its merger with the [Mellon Institute of Industrial Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellon_Institute_of_Industrial_Research \"Mellon Institute of Industrial Research\"), founded in 1913 by [Andrew Mellon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Mellon \"Andrew Mellon\") and [Richard B.

Carnegie's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers, many of whom worked in his mills. Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the [Pratt Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_Institute \"Pratt Institute\") in [Brooklyn, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn,_New_York \"Brooklyn, New York\"), founded by industrialist [Charles Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Pratt \"Charles Pratt\") in 1887.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University#cite_note-19) In 1912, the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) and began offering four-year degrees. During this time, CIT consisted of four constituent schools: the School of Fine and Applied Arts, the School of Apprentices and Journeymen, the School of Science and Technology, and the [Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Morrison_Carnegie_College \"Margaret Morrison Carnegie College\").\n\nThe [Mellon Institute of Industrial Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellon_Institute_of_Industrial_Research \"Mellon Institute of Industrial Research\") was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers [Andrew Mellon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Mellon \"Andrew Mellon\") (who went on to become [U.S. Treasury Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury \"United States Secretary of the Treasury\")) and [Richard B. Mellon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Mellon \"Richard B. Mellon\") in honor of their father, [Thomas Mellon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mellon \"Thomas Mellon\"), patriarch of the [Mellon family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellon_family \"Mellon family\"). The Institute began as a research organization that performed contract work for government and industry, initially as a department within the [University of Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh \"University of Pittsburgh\"). In 1927, the Mellon Institute was incorporated as an independent nonprofit. In 1937, the Mellon Institute's iconic building was completed on Fifth Avenue.[\\[20\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University#cite_note-20)\n\nIn 1967, with support from [Paul Mellon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mellon \"Paul Mellon\"), the Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University. In 1973, Carnegie Mellon's coordinate [women's college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_colleges_in_the_United_States \"Women's colleges in the United States\"), the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, merged its academic programs with the rest of the university.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University#cite_note-21) The industrial research mission of the Mellon Institute survived the merger as the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI) and continued doing work on contract to industry and government. In 2001, CMRI's programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into autonomous entities.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University#cite_note-22)\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the tenure of president [Richard Cyert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cyert \"Richard Cyert\") (1972–1990) witnessed a period of growth and development. The research budget grew from roughly $12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than $110 million in the late 1980s. Researchers in new fields like [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics \"Robotics\") and [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering \"Software engineering\") helped the university to build its reputation. One example was the introduction of the \" [Andrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Project \"Andrew Project\")\" computing network in the mid-1980s. This project linking all computers and workstations on campus set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a technology leader in education and research. On April 24, 1985, _cmu.edu_, Carnegie Mellon's Internet domain, became one of the [first six](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_currently_registered_Internet_domain_names#.edu \"List of the oldest currently registered Internet domain names\") [.edu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.edu \".edu\") domain names.\n\nIn the 1990s and into the 2000s, Carnegie Mellon solidified its status among American universities, consistently ranking in the top 25 in the national _[U.S. News & World Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._News_%26_World_Report \"U.S. News & World Report\")_ rankings, and in the top 30 (ranking 28th in 2022) amongst universities worldwide.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University#cite_note-ReferenceA-23)[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University#cite_note-topuniversities.com-24) Carnegie Mellon is distinct in its interdisciplinary approach to research and education. Through the establishment of programs and centers outside the limitations of departments or colleges, the university has established leadership in fields such as [computational finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_finance \"Computational finance\"), [information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems \"Information systems\"), [cognitive sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_sciences \"Cognitive sciences\"), management, arts management, product design, [behavioral economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics \"Behavioral economics\"), energy science and economics, [human–computer interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction \"Human–computer interaction\"), [entertainment technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_technology \"Entertainment technology\"), and [decision science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_science \"Decision science\").\n\nOn April 15, 1997, [Jared L. Cohon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Cohon \"Jared Cohon\"), former dean of the [Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_School_of_Forestry_%26_Environmental_Studies \"Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies\"), was elected president by Carnegie Mellon's board of trustees. During Cohon's presidency, Carnegie Mellon continued its trajectory of innovation and growth. His strategic plan aimed to leverage the university's strengths to benefit society in the areas of [biotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology \"Biotechnology\") and [life sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_sciences \"Life sciences\"), information and security technology, [environmental science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_science \"Environmental science\") and practices, the [fine arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_arts \"Fine arts\") and [humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities \"Humanities\"), and business and [public policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy \"Policy\"). In 2006, following negotiations between President Cohon and South Australian Premier [Mike Rann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rann \"Mike Rann\"), CMU opened a campus of the [Heinz College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_College \"Heinz College\") in the historic [Torrens Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrens_Building \"Torrens Building\") in [Adelaide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide \"Adelaide\"), Australia. President Cohon's term ended on June 30, 2013, after which he returned to the faculty at Carnegie Mellon.\n\nOn July 1, 2003, Carnegie Mellon launched \"Insp!re Innovation\", a $1 billion comprehensive fundraising campaign. Half of the campaign goal is intended for the endowment to provide long-lasting support for faculty, students and breakthrough innovations. The campaign brought in a total of $1.19 billion, with $578.5 million going toward Carnegie Mellon's endowment. It also enabled the university to establish 31 endowed professorships, 97 endowed fellowships and 250 endowed scholarships.[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University#cite_note-25)\n\nOn September 7, 2011, [William S.

Built in the 1950s, Skibo Hall's design was typical of [mid-century modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-century_modern \"Mid-century modern\") architecture but was poorly equipped to deal with advances in computer and internet connectivity. The original Skibo Hall was razed in the summer of 1994 and replaced by a new student union that is fully Wi-Fi enabled. Known as the University Center, the building was dedicated in 1996.

The period starting with the construction of the Hall of the Arts building (former home of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration) in 1952 and ending with Wean Hall in 1971 saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University. Around this time an expanding student population demanded improved facilities for student life, athletics and libraries. The campus expanded to Forbes Avenue from its original land along [Schenley Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenley_Park \"Schenley Park\").\n\n### Mid-20th century\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carnegie_Mellon_University&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Mid-20th century\")\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Carnegie_Mellon_Hamerschlag_Hall_and_Scott_Hall.jpg/250px-Carnegie_Mellon_Hamerschlag_Hall_and_Scott_Hall.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carnegie_Mellon_Hamerschlag_Hall_and_Scott_Hall.jpg) Hamerschlag, Roberts, and Scott Halls are three of the teaching facilities of the [College of Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_College_of_Engineering \"Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering\")\n\nThe buildings of this era reflected contemporary architectural styles. The [International Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Style_(architecture) \"International Style (architecture)\"), with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, had been in vogue in European settings since the 1930s. It came late to the Carnegie Mellon campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among American universities to abandon historical styles. By the 1960s, the International Style was adopted to accomplish needed expansion quickly and affordably with the swelling of student ranks in the aftermath of the [GI Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GI_Bill \"GI Bill\") in 1944. Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement, but not in its form or materials.\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Wean_hall.jpg/250px-Wean_hall.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wean_hall.jpg) Wean Hall, home of the world's first internet-enabled soda vending machine.[\\[36\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University#cite_note-36)\n\nStarting in the 1990s the university built a new university center (Cohon University Center), theater and drama building (Purnell Center for the Arts), business school building ( [Tepper School of Business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepper_School_of_Business \"Tepper School of Business\")), and several dormitories.\n\n### 2000s\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carnegie_Mellon_University&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: 2000s\")\\]\n\nBaker Hall was renovated in the early 2000s, and new chemistry labs were established in Doherty Hall soon after.

Ever since, painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition.[\\[156\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University#cite_note-159) The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus, in the area known as \"the Cut\". Students guard the fence 24 hours a day, and, as long as two vigils are maintained, no other student may \"take\" the fence. The fence can then be painted by the group that has it, but only between midnight and 6 am. Only hand brushes may be used; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine. The previous paint cannot be stripped, and each new painting adds a new layer. The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1' of surrounding paint, and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete. Today the fence is considered \"the world's most painted object\" by the _[Guinness Book of World Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_Book_of_World_Records \"Guinness Book of World Records\")_.[\\[157\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University#cite_note-160)\n\n## Athletics\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carnegie_Mellon_University&action=edit&section=25 \"Edit section: Athletics\")\\]\n\nThe Carnegie Mellon Tartans were a founding member of the [University Athletic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Athletic_Association \"University Athletic Association\") of [NCAA Division III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_III_(NCAA) \"Division III (NCAA)\").
