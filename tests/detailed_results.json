David inspired us with the stories found in his Brave Companions in 1991. Then came “Truman” in 1992 followed by “John Adams” (2001)—both Pulitzer Prize winners. In 2005, he took on the American Revolution with his “1776.” David had long been intrigued by the revolutionary generation, perhaps inspired by the stories he heard as a youth here in Western Pennsylvania about young George Washington.

He often quoted Librarian of Congress, Daniel Boorstin, who said that “trying to plan for the future without a sense of the past is like trying to plant cut flowers.” David, would then add, “today we’re raising a lot of cut flowers and trying to plant them!” He went to the White House to receive the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2011 David took us on “The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris,” which stayed on the New York Times best seller list longer than it took to build the Eiffel Tower. Pittsburgh’s Heinz History Center enjoyed hosting David’s book launches, which inevitably packed the house. He always stayed late to personalize the books he signed for the adoring hometown crowd.

Not a flight of fancy, mind you, but the story of “The Wright Brothers” who, of course, came to Pittsburgh for a lightweight aluminum engine block that enabled them to get their flyer off the ground. In 2019, David wrote his last book, “The Pioneers: The Heroic Story of the Settlers Who Brought the American Ideal West.” I once asked David, “when is the right time to retire?” He advised me that the secret to a long life is: “don’t ever retire.” He also pointed out that he wrote some of his best books, from “John Adams” to “The Pioneers,” after he had turned 65. He also reminded me of how important it was to be a teacher. “Stop and think about those teachers who changed your life, maybe with a single sentence, maybe with one lecture, maybe by just taking an interest in your struggle.” He said, “our new heroes should be the teachers, those who share their knowledge and their passion to inspire us to achieve great things and build a better future.” David wrote in his book, “The American Spirit,” that, “history is a larger way of looking at life. It is a source of strength, of inspiration. It is about who we are and what we stand for and is essential to our understanding of what our own role should",

Some rankings are designed purely for entertainment, little more than internet photo galleries. Others make a more serious effort at collecting information. Even where rankings do collect objective statistics such as test scores or costs, the choice of which factors to include in a ranking, and how those factors are weighted, remains subjective. The effects of those methodologies, and the reasons for those choices, are not always readily apparent. For prospective students, families, potential staff and faculty who are deciding whether to invest time and resources in an institution, it is essential that you decide what factors are important to your success and the outcomes you seek. Those will include some objective information, which you can find on the pages of the Carnegie Mellon University website, or on sites for which CMU provides information, such as [IPEDS College Navigator](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/#College%20Navigator \"College Navigator\") or [collegedata.com](http://www.collegedata.com/#CollegeData.com \"CollegeData.com\").

Ultimately, the long-standing tussle shows the peculiar human desire to be first. Claiming a “first” brings pride to a community and shows, in their minds, that they are more innovative, more welcoming to inventors, or just plain smarter for having created something before others … no matter how many qualifiers must be added after the word “first.” Gulf may not have been the first drive-in, or first to call itself a service station, but it undoubtedly had the foresight to design its building for convenience, then deliver its products and services in a welcoming, professional manner that set the standard for all that followed. Perhaps we can call it “the world’s first architect-designed, drive-in service station.” ## About the Author Brian Butko has published books on local and roadside businesses, and is writing a haunted historical mystery inspired by his hometown quarry.

By Barbara Klein Lizzy DeVita in front of her work as displayed in the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh’s Annual in 2008. © Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 2010, all rights reserved. Reprinted with permission As far as the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh (AAP) is concerned, some benchmarks are more about a constancy of purpose than a measure of change. Celebrating its centennial year, this predominately volunteer-driven, artist-run organization is the oldest continuously exhibiting visual arts group in the country. Founded in 1910 when traditional landscapes, portraits, and still lifes ruled, AAP has remained relevant by providing artists with the means to see and be seen.Its most prestigious event, the Annual, is open to all artists 18 years of age and older living within a 150-mile radius of Pittsburgh. It’s this vehicle that has enabled AAP not only to survive, but also to present more regional art to the public than any other group in the city. At last count, in its first 50 years alone, more than 10,000 works were displayed—some created by artists exhibiting for the very first time (a statistic that makes AAP very proud). More often than not, this juried exhibition, dubbed “Popular Salon of the People” by the Pittsburgh Press, has been held at Carnegie Museum of Art. The 2010 show opens at the museum on July 24.Throughout the decades, the Annual has served as an artistic-affirming, resume-building, and buzz-generating event for the likes of Mary Cassatt, Edward Hopper, Philip Pearlstein, and Andy Warhol.Add to that list Lizzy DeVita. Her entries in the last three Annuals caught the eye of a local gallery owner and, as a result, have earned this East Liberty resident a solo show in 2011.Growing up in Pittsburgh, DeVita, not unlike Warhol, couldn’t wait to leave town. But soon after graduating from New York City’s Barnard College and landing a job with a “fancy” printmaking company, she began to find the Big Apple a bit daunting. “At this point in my career, which is the beginning,” the 23-year-old says, “it occurred to me that it might be a deterrent to stay in New York because art is so market-driven there.” She made the decision to move back to her hometown and quickly took a job with a non-profit agency that affords her enough money to eat and enough time to explore her art. For Chilean-born Alberto Almarza, an artist and teacher, Pittsburgh has provided fertile ground to grow his artistic sensibilities. According to Almarza, who arrived here 10 years ago when he was just 18, the city and art are in sync. “Pittsburgh offers a whole range of artistic expression,” he says, “from galleries and museums to street art, computer geeks, and punks.”That’s not quite the picture Robert Qualters would have painted as a young artist living and working",

Visual Arts. Festivals. Arts Education. Urban Development.\n\nSince 1984, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, a non-profit arts organization, has worked to make the Steel City a place where the arts can flourish. Our efforts have focused on the cultural and economic development of the Cultural District, a 14-square-block area of downtown Pittsburgh. What was once a downtrodden red light district now thrives as a vibrant center for culture, art, food, and community. Pittsburgh’s Cultural District stands as a nationwide model for how the arts can play a pivotal role in urban revitalization.\n\nEach year, millions of people visit the Cultural District to expand their horizons in our theaters, galleries, and public art environments. Patrons enjoy thousands of [world-class performing arts events](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/events/series) and [visual arts exhibitions](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/visual-arts). Pittsburgh residents of all ages connect and learn with the Trust’s [comprehensive education](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/education) and community engagement opportunities. Local arts organizations collaborate to build a stronger cultural community through the [power of partnerships](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/about/organization/shared-services).\n\nThe Cultural District acts as the anchor for all of that work. The Trust’s [superior venues](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/visit/facilities) and [gallery spaces](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/visual-arts/galleries) allow resident companies, community organizations, artists, and promoters to reach audiences large and small. In total, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust manages more than [one million square feet of real estate](http://issuu.com/culturaltrust/docs/trust_facility_map?mode=window&backgroundColor=%23222222) in the District. Step outside those buildings to find numerous [public art installations](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/visual-arts/public-art) that beautify Pittsburgh's largest arts neighborhood.\n\nLauded as “the single greatest creative force in Pittsburgh because of its spirit of reinvention” by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, the Trust strives every day to enrich the city of Pittsburgh’s vibrancy, diversity, and prosperity.\n\nMenu[Calendar](https://trustarts.org/calendar)\n\nSearch[Cart](https://trustarts.org/shopping_cart/show)\n\n### Join Our Newsletter!\n\n[Learn More](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/about/email-signup)\n\n#### Follow Us\n\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CulturalTrust?v=wall)\n- [Twitter](https://x.com/culturaltrust)\n- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/culturaltrust)\n\n### Administrative Offices:\n\nCopyright 2025.

        "text": "as a list of regional scholarships available for youth of color listed alongside exhibition content focused on economics. Though a section of the exhibition is devoted to education, some students wondered out loud if RACE’s larger focus was on adult audiences, noting the exhibition’s very adult issues of money, housing, and illness. It’s a reminder, they say, that their voices are frequently not considered valuable—the exact oversight the workshops and the summit seek to correct. They did see themselves in the section of the show that highlights the Hapa Project, a multiracial identity art project created by American artist Kip Fulbeck. The Pittsburgh showing of RACE features 17 of the 1,200 minimalist portraits taken by the artist of individuals who self-identified as being of mixed ethnic heritage. After being photographed, participants chose their own terms to describe themselves, then responded to the question, “What are you?” in their own handwriting. The responses, some from children and teens, stopped many of the high schoolers in their tracks. Among their favorites: “My last boyfriend told me he liked me because of my race. So I dumped him.” The teens embraced the exercise. Joan Mukogosi, a 16-year-old junior at Winchester Thurston, wrote, “I am an African-American. My dad is 100% Kenyan and 100% awesome. My mom is a black-American and my hero!” Carrie Mannino, 15, wrote, “I’m a writer— mostly a poet. I celebrate Christmas and Hanukah because I’m ‘half and half.’ I check white but I wish there were more options. If anyone asks, I say I’m an artist.” Others identified themselves without mentioning race or ethnicity. Mollie March-Steinman, 17, a senior at Pittsburgh Creative and Performance Arts, sees herself as “a little too much. Too many opinions, too much talking, rambling, ranting, not enough doing or experiencing. I gotta step out of my comfort zone.” It’s telling to note that each of the 20 teens chose to do just that, voluntarily spending part of their summer at the museum talking openly about very personal topics. March-Steinman, a writer like Mannino, who identifies as “100% vanilla,” adds, “I see adults skirt around \\[the topic of race\\] a lot. It’s like, just chill, everyone’s affected by it.” She says being white doesn’t excuse her from the discussion. As head of her school’s Black Student Union, an afterschool club that frequently engages in discussions around race, Mukogosi says, “This just seems like the right place for me. I’m really excited to see how our work affects other students. Often in school, the people like us who are active don’t receive the amount of support that we want from our peers. Hopefully we can help other people care.” Also in this issue: Storyteller · Shock and Awe · Look Again · Thinking Like a Scientist · Director’s Note · NewsWorthy · Face Time: Jo Ellen Parker · Artistic License: Out of the Vault · Science & Nature: The Body on Stage · Travel Log · The Big Picture Copyright © 2017 CARNEGIE Magazine.

        "text": "The Wentz-to-Addison dagger may have been much more damaging had inside linebacker Payton Wilson not sprinted down the field and tackled Addison in bounds at the Steelers' 1. The Vikings ended up requiring an additional four plays to score in the wake of Wilson's relentless hustle. \"It was unbelievable,\" Austin said. \"It's probably the difference in the game. You make them run three plays. You make them burn time off the clock. And then if they do, and they did, get an opportunity to go back down, now you're talking about a minute less time to try to get into field goal range. \"So it was a huge play. It's why we talk to our guys all the time, that's why we run to the ball. We talk about it in practice all the time, to finish and do those things and he did it and it was a great individual effort. His individual effort helped our team win the game.\" Outside linebacker Nick Herbig also made his individual presence felt again in his second consecutive start in place of Alex Highsmith (ankle). Herbig's pressure induced an intentional grounding penalty against Wentz on first-and-10 from the Minnesota 39 with 43 seconds left. Herbig finished with 1.5 sacks, a tackle for a loss and three quarterback hits against Minnesota after producing a sack, a tackle for a loss and four quarterback hits in the Steelers' 21-14 win on Sept. 21 at New England. His emergence has the Steelers re-evaluating the division of labor at outside linebacker once Highsmith returns from injury. \"We are not gonna limit Nick Herbig,\" Austin announced. \"He is showing up every week. He is disruptive. He's a really good player for us and we're gonna continue to find ways to get him on the field.\" ## Related Content [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/blegye2xrp2iswguqo8k.jpg)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Smith: 'We looked smooth Sunday'**\\\\ \\\\ A successful onsides kick recovery heped seal the win against the Vikings](https://www.steelers.com/news/smith-we-looked-smooth-sunday \"Smith: 'We looked smooth Sunday' \") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/lwidw4lcavpbfqegfeed.jpg)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Coordinators keep working**\\\\ \\\\ There's still a ways to go but signs they can get there](https://www.steelers.com/news/coordinators-keep-working \"Coordinators keep working\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/v6hjvhwrs2ie2jav4gnk.jpg)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Weighty moments**\\\\ \\\\ Steelers working toward better execution on impactful snaps on both sides of the ball](https://www.steelers.com/news/weighty-moments \"Weighty moments\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/q1hpey9d1ilhtuh44yuw.jpg)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Room for improvement**\\\\ \\\\ Steelers beat Jets despite getting less than they seek from running game, run defense](https://www.steelers.com/news/room-for-improvement \"Room for improvement\") [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **'You've got to see around corners'**\\\\ \\\\ Steelers armed with optimism, perspective as season commences](https://www.steelers.com/news/you-ve-got-to-see-around-corners \"'You've got to see around corners'\") [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **One step at a time**\\\\ \\\\ Ground game, run defense following similar, steady trajectories](https://www.steelers.com/news/one-step-at-a-time \"One step at a time\") [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Getting a feel for them**\\\\ \\\\ Offensive coordinator Arthur Smith and defensive coordinator Teryl Austin liked what they saw in the preseason opener, but there is still work to be done](https://www.steelers.com/news/getting-a-feel-for-them \"Getting a feel for them\") [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Smith wants to maximize everyone's talents**\\\\ \\\\ Steelers OC accepts challenges of",

The opera deals not only with Thompson’s suffering in the jungle of southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, but also the tragic aftermath that followed his liberation. Colonel Thompson endured his brutal captivity by doggedly clinging to memories of his loving wife Alyce and their children. Alyce, however, believed Jim was dead. She and her children moved to Massachusetts with another man, leading to a painful reunion after Jim’s release. **Glory Denied** is, above all, the story of an American family during one our nation’s most turbulent eras. In its review of Mr. Philpott’s book, The New York Times stated: _Indeed it is not too much to say that **Glory Denied** and Colonel Thompson’s mixed feelings about it encapsulate something of the moral essence of the Vietnam War and the imperishable bitterness of its legacy._ **Glory Denied** will star Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artists, and be performed in the intimate environs of Pittsburgh Opera Headquarters. Limited capacity - order now! \" _Glory Denied as a whole is in keeping with Pittsburgh Opera’s past record of presenting contemporary works by gifted and impressive Resident Artists. The company deserves praise for consistently offering opportunities to hear rarities delivered by strong, young talent, and patronage is the only reward commensurate with its efforts...the work deserves full houses for all._\" - [Pittsburgh in the Round](https://www.pghintheround.com/pittsburgh-operas-premiere-of-glory-denied/) Older Thompson (Benjamin Taylor), Older Alyce (Caitlin Gotimer), Younger Alyce (Ashley Fabian) and Younger Thompson (Terrence Chin-Loy).

He led the move to [Bitz Opera Factory](https://pittsburghopera.org/facilities/pittsburgh-opera-headquarters/?hsLang=en) in the historic George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory at 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, and developed a range of audience and community programs that take place there.

Common Pittsburghese terms are: \"slippy\" (slippery), \"redd up\" (clean up), \"jagger bush\" (thorn bush), and \"gum bands\" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb \"to be\".

In May 2009, Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony embarked on a tour to Asia. The first international tour with Honeck as music director marked the Orchestra’s debut in Shanghai, China and Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and the Orchestra’s first performance in Beijing since 1987. In fall 2009, Honeck and the orchestra were invited to close the prestigious Lucerne Festival in Lucerne, Switzerland. The Symphony has gone on many tours since then, performing in concert halls across Europe and in Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center within the U.S. Honeck has extended his contract with the Pittsburgh Symphony for a remarkable third time, through the 2027-2028 season. Honeck continues to create remarkable collaborations between the Pittsburgh Symphony and other conductors and musicians as well. His staged version of Handel’s _Messiah_ set across three periods of American history with stage director Samuel Helfrich in 2011 was a remarkable achievement. Helfrich returned to work with Honeck and the Symphony on a semi-staged presentation of Bach’s St. John Passion in 2016 and Haydn’s _Creation_ in 2017.Superstar cellist Yo-Yo Ma, violinist Itzhak Perlman, pianist Lang Lang, and violinist Joshua Bell have performed as guest soloists at Pittsburgh Symphony gala concerts, and notable debuts during Honeck’s tenure include pianists Daniil Trifonov and Til Fellner, percussionist Martin Grubinger and violinist Augustin Hadelich, among others. Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony are also deeply committed to the Music for the Spirit program, a series of concerts that evolved from the historic appearance of the Pittsburgh Symphony at the Vatican in 2004. This series of community concerts developed a partnership between the orchestra and local faith communities and celebrates the spiritual and universal message of music. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Pittsburgh Symphony to cancel the remainder of its concerts for the 2019-2020 season. Instead, the Symphony offered online concerts throughout the 2020-2021 season. The Pittsburgh Symphony celebrated its 125th anniversary with an online gala in February 2021. In summer of 2021, the Pittsburgh Symphony began to perform to a live audience outdoors, and eventually in the fall, Heinz Hall was reopened to audiences. In 2020, the Pittsburgh Symphony welcomed its second Principal Pops Conductor, [Byron Stripling](https://www.pittsburghsymphony.org/biography/byron-stripling). A conductor, trumpet virtuoso, singer, and actor, Stripling has been a featured soloist with pops orchestras across the country. He has performed with jazz notables from the Count Basie Orchestra and the bands of Dizzy Gillespie, Dave Brubeck, Lionel Hampton, and more. Stripling’s first concert as Principal Pops conductor was an online performance in October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. He continued to have multiple “firsts” with the symphony, performing his first in-person concert in summer of 2021 at Hartwood Acres, and his first in-person Pops concert of the season at Heinz Hall in fall of the same year.

Austrian born, Honeck studied music at the Academy of Music in Vienna. He performed in various capacities with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra — as violinist, violist and guest conductor. In addition to his directorship of the Pittsburgh Symphony, Honeck has served as music director of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra and Staatsoper Stuttgart and as guest conductor of the Czech Philharmonic. At the time of his appointment, Honeck remarked, “It is with great joy that I assume the post of music director of one of the world's finest orchestras. I am aware that this wonderful task is accompanied by great responsibility with regard to maintaining and enhancing the high level of performance developed by my predecessors and the orchestra together. It is no exaggeration to say that the orchestra and I got on like a house on fire.” The sentiment could not be truer, with the orchestra and Maestro Honeck receiving rave reviews for their collaborations, including their [many recordings](http://pittsburghsymphonyorchestra.bigcartel.com/products?search=manfred+honeck&search-submit=) together, with the first in 2009 on the Exton label, Strauss’ _Ein Heldenleben_.

Intimidated by opera? Don't be! Let's debunk some common opera myths together! If you’ve never been to the opera before, you may have some misconceptions. Don't worry, you're not alone! So let's shake off your preconceptions and learn what going to the opera is really like... Come as you are or glam it up! On weeknights people often show up in what they wore to the office that day, and on Fridays and Sundays, we see everything from dressy to jeans. On Saturdays – opening nights – some like to wear a suit or step out in a special dress. But just wear whatever makes you feel comfortable! _Everyone in this photo is dressed perfectly for the opera! (Photo credit: David Bachman)_ Tickets to Pittsburgh Opera's mainstage shows at the Benedum and Byham start at only $15... children and teens can even get in at half that price. That's less than a movie ticket and some popcorn! There are even discounts for [groups of 6+](https://pittsburghopera.org/tickets/groups-tickets?hsLang=en), [students](https://www.pittsburghopera.org/tickets/student-tickets/cheapseats/?hsLang=en), [20-Something Tuesdays](https://pittsburghopera.org/tickets/promotions-and-discounts/?hsLang=en) and more. English texts are always projected above the stage, just like subtitles at the movies. While many operas are in Italian, German, or French, there are many in English too. You'll understand every word! Do you think sword fights are boring? What about dancing, poisonings, secret plots, epic romances, or twist endings? Operas have these in spades! That's why the term \"operatic\" has come to mean \"dramatic to the nth degree.\" _These two will slice your notions of \"boring\" to threads! (Photo credit: David Bachman)_ Operas come in all shapes and sizes! The shortest opera we know of is 13 minutes long, and the longest one takes 7 days! You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under \"Details and Resources.\" Many operas are the same length as any musical or play, with an intermission or two along the way. Just like music has changed a lot in the last 400 years, opera has too! While almost all operas make use",

The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season.

The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page. ### Usage in popular culture - The January 11, 1975, episode of the _[Mary Tyler Moore Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\")_ featured [Super Bowl IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_IX \"Super Bowl IX\") (featuring the Steelers) as a plot device.[\\[225\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-p506-226) - _[Black Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sunday_(1977_film) \"Black Sunday (1977 film)\")_ in 1977[\\[226\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-r500-227) - _[Heaven Can Wait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Can_Wait_(1978_film) \"Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)\")_ in 1978[\\[227\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-h078-228) - _[Smokey and the Bandit II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_and_the_Bandit_II \"Smokey and the Bandit II\")_ in",

        "text": "# Meadowcroft Rockshelter\n\nDig into archaeological evidence that reveals the earliest signs of human habitation dating back 19,000 years.\n\nIf not for the curiosity of a Washington County, Pa., farmer six decades ago, Meadowcroft Rockshelter – the oldest site of human habitation in North America – might have never been discovered. In 1955, Albert Miller stumbled upon a groundhog hole on his family’s farm in Avella and uncovered what looked to be a prehistoric tool.\n\nMiller chose to cover up the hole and carefully search for a professional archeologist who could properly assess the historical significance of the site. Almost two decades later in 1973, Miller finally connected with University of Pittsburgh anthropology professor Dr. James Adovasio who visited the farm and looked at the object found near the groundhog hole.\n\nAstonished by the artifact, which was a prehistoric flint knife, Dr. Adovasio assembled a team of archaeology, anthropology and geology students to study the area as part of a curriculum. The field school’s excavation of the site over the next six years yielded nearly two million artifacts and ecofacts, including ancient stone tools, pottery fragments, and evidence of ice-age fire pits.\n\nFurther testing of the newly found artifacts concluded that the rock ledge overhang – naturally formed by the waters of Cross Creek – served as a campsite for prehistoric hunters and gatherers 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter provided shelter for visitors with nearby fresh water springs and sources of plants and animals for food.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior designated Meadowcroft Rockshelter a National Historic Landmark.\n\nDiscover this important archeological treasure for yourself and visit Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. Tours of the Rockshelter are available during regular operating hours and begin in the Meadowcroft visitor center.\n\n**During Meadowcroft’s open season, daily tours of the Rockshelter begin at the Visitors Center. Tour times vary and last approximately one hour.**\n\nFor information about scheduling and reservations, please contact Meadowcroft at 724-587-3412 or meadowcroftinfo@heinzhistorycenter.org.\n\n## Explore the Rockshelter\n\nVirtual Exhibit\n\nMeadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village\n\nThis GigaPan is a series of interactive images that allows anyone to explore the Meadowcroft Rockshelter archaeological site from any computer.

Visit the Fort Pitt Block House, Frick Building and many more during your visit. ## Downtown ### Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail Complex Stunningly beautiful. Singularly graceful. A symphony of arches. Considered by many to be the leading architect of the 19th century, Henry Hobson Richardson's 19th century neo-medieval design combines stunning brickwork and crisp granite detail. An outdoor fountain in the courtyard park highlights the magnificent riverfront structure, while the Bridge of Sighs (mirroring the Venice original) --at one time used to transport prisoners--connects the Courthouse to the former jail. What Richardson considered his best work remains among elite architectural company in Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle. ### BNY Mellon Born out of a merger between The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation, The Bank of New York Mellon has a substantial Pittsburgh presence. It's the oldest banking corporation in the nation - tracing its roots back to Alexander Hamilton. BNY Mellon Center is 55 stories and was completed in 1983. It is the second-tallest building in the city, boasts an eight-sided design and a rooftop heliport. On a clear day it is possible to spot the building from as far as 50 miles away. ### Fort Pitt Block House The Block House is the oldest structure in the City of Pittsburgh and the last vestige of the British Empire, built here in 1764 by the English Army. Much of its original fabric is still intact and it is open and free to the public year-round as an historic landmark. The Block House is the focal point in Point State Park where the three rivers of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny, the Ohio and the Monongahela, meet. ### Frick Building The Frick Building (1901-02), the first of industrialist Henry Clay Frick's architectural ventures on Grant Street, Downtown. In 1903, Leslie's Weekly judged it \"the finest office building in the world,\" and no wonder: Daniel Burnham gave the coke and steel king a vertical version of the White City, a neo-classical tower with a dazzling white, T-shaped marble lobby, clean and crisp as a new dollar bill; bronze lions flanking the entrance; and John La Farge's stained glass window, \"Fortune and Her Wheel,\" above a marble bust of Frick installed after his death in 1919. ### Fifth Avenue Place Home to Highmark, Pennsylvania's largest health insurer, Fifth Avenue Place was completed in 1988 and has 31 floors. The structure is made of a unique granite frame for roughly 450 feet and then collapses inward in a pyramid shape for another 124-foot-tall roof structure. Protruding from the top of the skyscraper is a 178-foot-tall mast. Despite its rounded appearance, the 13-story structure is actually 12-sided and measures four feet in diameter. ### Gulf Tower Rising 44 stories above the Downtown skyline,",

He helps me stretch my imagination.” – Madelyn Roehrig A local artist-educator discovers that she’s not alone in her quest to channel her inner Andy Warhol. By Julie Hannon Madelyn Roehrig visits Andy Warhol’s gravesite every day—for a year and counting. Ever wonder what outrageous ideas Andy Warhol would dream up in this digital age of push-button publishing, instant status updates, and 24-hour news? Now you can ask him. Asking Andy anything is the idea behind Madelyn Roehrig’s ongoing art project, Figments: Conversations with Andy, in which the artist-educator is documenting who visits the late artist’s grave and, more interestingly, why. Last February, Roehrig left a notebook at Warhol’s hillside gravesite in Bethel Park, about 10 miles south of Pittsburgh, encouraging visitors to ask Andy a question or leave a comment. Since then, she’s collected 230 handwritten messages—along with a white wig, a plastic penis, a rosary, paint brushes, crystals, Gas-X pills, a Celebrity tomato plant, numerous Coca-Cola bottles, and a plethora of Campbell’s soup cans—all left for the king of Pop Art. A photographer inquired, “Dear Andy, How do you put models at ease?” A designer traveling all the way from Mexico confessed, “I’m your #1 fan and you are my inspiration.” Another visitor confided, “Sorry you can’t be friends on Facebook and Twitter. You would have loved that.” “My husband Matthew and I drove all the way from Miami, Florida, just to be here with you,” wrote Julie R. “You were an amazing artist and a truly weird person. Hope all is well down there, the world up here misses you.” Most only leave their first names. Some live within walking distance but others have come from as far away as the Czech Republic. And they’re an eclectic bunch, including one of Warhol’s classmates (a 90-year-old Bethel Park man who now lives within eyeshot of Andy), belly dancers, budding artists, adoring fans and haters alike, tourists, grade-schoolers, and entire families on a pilgrimage to visit someone they talk to like an old friend. “Hi Andy, I brought my two small daughters with me today to see where you were buried because we’ve been discussing your art and they think it’s cool. My oldest—age 8—has been arranging soup cans all around the house. Hope you are doing well in the creative afterlife,” signed anonymous. “Today is my 18th birthday … I’m going to college to be a painter,” wrote Samantha Jo. “It’s the greatest feeling, right? Makes me feel so alive. Thanks for the inspiration.” And if writing Andy a message by hand is too 20th century for some gravesite guests, Roehrig also mans Figments: Conversations with Andy on Facebook and the Andy Warhol Hotline at412.508.9245. So far, Andy has received 22 calls. “I was just going to take a picture here every day,” she explains, motioning toward Andy’s tombstone, tucked away in the",

The museum currently has seven floors of gallery and exhibition space as well as an underground education studio and conservation lab.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-7) Warhol's primary artistic technique was silkscreen pop art, which he gained notoriety for in the early 1960s. The serial images derived from the culture's consumerism and conception of beauty are reified in a form of art which represent the identity of constituents in postwar American society.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Museums_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-8) Images used by Warhol, which have made him famous for his contributions to [pop art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art \"Pop art\"), include celebrities and consumables such as [Marilyn Monroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe \"Marilyn Monroe\") and [The Campbell's soup can](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/308567011944870696/).

The museum was founded as the Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute in 1895.

Today the museum continues showcasing [contemporary art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_art \"Contemporary art\") by staging the [Carnegie International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_International \"Carnegie International\") exhibition every three to five years. Numerous works from the International exhibitions have been acquired for the museums' permanent collection including [Winslow Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winslow_Homer \"Winslow Homer\")'s _The Wreck_ (1896) and [James A. McNeill Whistler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._McNeill_Whistler \"James A.

The Sarah Scaife Foundation gift nearly doubled the exhibition square footage. The modernist addition was designed to not compete with the existing building. Trustee James L.

Hope you are doing well in the creative afterlife,” signed anonymous. “Today is my 18th birthday … I’m going to college to be a painter,” wrote Samantha Jo. “It’s the greatest feeling, right? Makes me feel so alive. Thanks for the inspiration.” And if writing Andy a message by hand is too 20th century for some gravesite guests, Roehrig also mans Figments: Conversations with Andy on Facebook and the Andy Warhol Hotline at412.508.9245. So far, Andy has received 22 calls. “I was just going to take a picture here every day,” she explains, motioning toward Andy’s tombstone, tucked away in the non-descript St. John Byzantine Catholic Cemetery at the corner of Route 88 and Connor Road, where Warhol was buried with his parents. “But as I did, I started noticing things showing up, gifts for Andy, and I realized other people came, too. And I wondered why. I wanted to know what they were thinking and what they were asking—what they wanted from Andy. I also wanted to capture it all without being invasive, but I didn’t know what to do. So I asked Andy.” Roehrig does a lot of that—asking Andy. Living only three miles from the gravesite, she’s been visiting Warhol infrequently since 2006, and now, for this project, every day for more than a year. She says she talks to him “Whenever I have a situation.” These “situations” are almost always of the creative kind, and Andy almost always delivers. “I believe Andy is listening,” says Roehrig, “that’s why it works. He helps me stretch my imagination.” It all started when Roehrig, an education specialist at Carnegie Museum of Art, was stalled on an art installation she was developing for an exhibition at Seton Hill Uni­versity. Upon the anniversary of September 11, she started exploring terroristic images that enter people’s homes by way of their television sets. This conjured up Warhol’s famous Death and Disaster paintings, and off she went to sit and talk with Andy. Roehrig acknowledges that while this might seem odd to some, this kind of stream-of-consciousness thinking and quiet time at a cemetery isn’t so unusual for her, as she regularly visits and talks to her deceased parents and grandparents. Not long after talking it through with Andy, she decided that the best way to display the violent images she had captured from her television was to make time-based videos using the black-and-white images as a montage. It’s a ritual that’s become a part of her artistic process, and her life. A private part of her life until her classmates at Vermont College of Fine Arts, where she completed her master’s degree last year, pointed out the fact that her connection to Andy is her artwork. So the documenting began: recording the handwritten notes and eventually videotaping willing visitors. (Beginning April 11, Roehrig will videotape gravesite visitors from noon-2 p.m. on the second Sunday of every month). And",

In 1955, Albert Miller stumbled upon a groundhog hole on his family’s farm in Avella and uncovered what looked to be a prehistoric tool.\n\nMiller chose to cover up the hole and carefully search for a professional archeologist who could properly assess the historical significance of the site. Almost two decades later in 1973, Miller finally connected with University of Pittsburgh anthropology professor Dr. James Adovasio who visited the farm and looked at the object found near the groundhog hole.\n\nAstonished by the artifact, which was a prehistoric flint knife, Dr. Adovasio assembled a team of archaeology, anthropology and geology students to study the area as part of a curriculum. The field school’s excavation of the site over the next six years yielded nearly two million artifacts and ecofacts, including ancient stone tools, pottery fragments, and evidence of ice-age fire pits.\n\nFurther testing of the newly found artifacts concluded that the rock ledge overhang – naturally formed by the waters of Cross Creek – served as a campsite for prehistoric hunters and gatherers 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter provided shelter for visitors with nearby fresh water springs and sources of plants and animals for food.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior designated Meadowcroft Rockshelter a National Historic Landmark.\n\nDiscover this important archeological treasure for yourself and visit Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. Tours of the Rockshelter are available during regular operating hours and begin in the Meadowcroft visitor center.\n\n**During Meadowcroft’s open season, daily tours of the Rockshelter begin at the Visitors Center. Tour times vary and last approximately one hour.**\n\nFor information about scheduling and reservations, please contact Meadowcroft at 724-587-3412 or meadowcroftinfo@heinzhistorycenter.org.\n\n## Explore the Rockshelter\n\nVirtual Exhibit\n\nMeadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village\n\nThis GigaPan is a series of interactive images that allows anyone to explore the Meadowcroft Rockshelter archaeological site from any computer.

In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\") was started, and in 1787, the [Pittsburgh Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh \"University of Pittsburgh\") was chartered. Unrest during the [Whiskey Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion \"Whiskey Rebellion\") of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400.

[Fort Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pitt_(Pennsylvania) \"Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)\") (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the [Northwest Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territory \"Northwest Territory\"). ### 19th century \\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: 19th century\")\\] Further information: [Pennsylvania in the American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_in_the_American_Civil_War \"Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\") [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Monongahela_River_Scene_Pittsburgh_PA_1857.jpg/250px-Monongahela_River_Scene_Pittsburgh_PA_1857.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Monongahela_River_Scene_Pittsburgh_PA_1857.jpg) The [Monongahela River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monongahela_River \"Monongahela River\") and its surroundings in 1857 [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Pittsburgh_1874_Otto_Krebs.jpg/250px-Pittsburgh_1874_Otto_Krebs.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pittsburgh_1874_Otto_Krebs.jpg) [Lithograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography \"Lithography\") of Pittsburgh by [Otto Krebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Krebs \"Otto Krebs\") (before 1874) The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the [Lewis and Clark Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition \"Lewis and Clark Expedition\").[\\[38\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-38) Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when [Meriwether Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meriwether_Lewis \"Meriwether Lewis\") purchased a [keelboat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keelboat \"Keelboat\") that would later be used to ascend the [Missouri River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River \"Missouri River\").[\\[39\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-39) The [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\") cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many [Welsh people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_people \"Welsh people\") from the [Merthyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merthyr \"Merthyr\") steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the [Merthyr Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merthyr_Rising \"Merthyr Rising\"). By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the [Allegheny Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_Mountains \"Allegheny Mountains\"). The [Great Fire of Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_Pittsburgh \"Great Fire of Pittsburgh\") destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the [Great Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland) \"Great Famine (Ireland)\").

As they were from Austria, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, England and Brazil, to name just a few among numerous other exotic points of origin represented in Ireland for the spectacle that was Steelers-Vikings last Sunday. As anticipated, most were Steelers fans. What was surprising was how many were there for the game, not necessarily Terrible Towel waving or \"Renegade\" or anything else that had more to do with entertainment and fan engagement than it did the actual playing of American football. One Brazilian, in particular, betrayed the depth of understanding and knowledge of the game many Steelers fans from all over the world brought with them to the Emerald Isle, even those who showed up despite not in possession of tickets. \"They need to invest more in the offensive line.\" He was reminded offensive tackles Broderick Jones and Troy Fautanu are both former first-round picks and center Zach Frazier is a former second-round selection, but was still not deterred. The boys from Brazil would like to focus on the continued development of the offensive line, and that wasn't the only time such nuance and detail were passionately discussed in an overflowing pub where someone was singing Cranberries songs and the decor included a \"John F. Kennedy for President\" poster from 1960 on one wall and a bronze representation of James Joyce in front of another. Welcome to Dublin. ——— This wasn't, after further review, where the streets had no name. And the names were all recognizable to the Steelers fans crowding up and down the cobblestones of the Temple Bar district, touring the Guinness Storehouse or visiting Christ Church Cathedral, Trinity College or any of the numerous other local attractions. The nameplates and numbers on the backs of authentic jerseys were omnipresent. \"Roethlisberger 7,\" and \"Bettis 36\" and \"Greene 75\" and \"Russell 34,\" to name just a few; almost every era of Steelers football, it seemed, was on display. And it wasn't just fans celebrating their favorite players. A host of former Steelers were there in the flesh. The group included Bettis, Mark Bruener, James Farrior, Brett Keisel, Carnell Lake, Maurice Pouncey, Roethlisberger, John Stallworth, Max Starks and Ike Taylor. They enthusiastically showed up for events such as football camps (including one in Belfast, Northern Ireland), Q&A's at Fitzsimons Pub, a flag football event at the U.S. Ambassador's residence and a tailgate. The ex-players sampled a pint or two and served as good will ambassadors throughout. They didn't want to miss this, either. Fitzsimons served as an unofficial headquarters for Steelers fans and hosted broadcasts on Steelers Nation Radio and WDVE-FM in Pittsburgh, the flagship station on the Steelers Audio Network, and Steelers fans responded. According to Romy Carroll, manager of sales and marketing for Fitzsimons, business was up about 50 percent over an average weekend and surpassed annual events such as St. Patrick's Day and the All-Ireland Finals for rugby and Gaelic football (which draw",

The idea for the practice jerseys originated with Steelers equipment manager Adam Regan, who presented it to team President Art Rooney II and Vice President of Business Development & Strategy Dan Rooney. **Fitzsimons Pub: Home Away From Home** One of Dublin's most historic pubs turned into homebase for Steelers Nation over the course of game weekend. Fitzsimons Pub, located in Temple Bar, literally became part of Steelers Country – with branding on both the inside and outside of the pub. Live entertainment included Irish music, as well as 8+ hours a day of live Steelers audio programming, including SNR Drive & The WDVE Morning Show, emanating from the top floor of the pub each day. Fans were also treated to alumni appearances, including one by Maurkice Pouncey, who poured his own pint from behind the bar! Over a three day period, over 3,000 fans visited Fitzsimmons. \"We normally have strong weekends when it comes to the All-Ireland Finals, Irish Rugby, Irish Football, New Years Eve & even St. Patrick's weekend, which is normally our strongest weekend every year,\" said Romy Carroll, the pub's Sales & Marketing Manager. \"But we've never seen anything like the crowds of supporters and fans that the Steelers bought in to Fitzsimons over the weekend.\" **Fan Tailgate in Merrion Square Park** From Friday through Sunday, the Fáilte Steelers Tailgate, presented by Aer Lingus, provided a place for Steelers fans to gather in the heart of Dublin's City Centre in picturesque Merrion Square Park. Over the course of the three days, over 20,000 Steelers fans attended the free event and enjoyed food and beverage, live music and entertainment, lawn games, video programming and much more. The weekend kicked off with a bang as those in attendance were treated to a Q&A session with Legends Ben Roethlisberger, Maurkice Pouncey and Ike Taylor. Saturday included performances from lrish dancers, a live band and more alumni appearances from Max Starks and James Farrior. Sunday provided a place for fans to watch the game for free on two large video screens. The Tailgate also featured American football youth flag clinics, presented by Aer Lingus & UPMC. Over the course of three days, over 200 young people got coaching tips from Steelers Legends. **A Visit To The Ambassador's Residence** The NFL hosted a flag football event at the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland's residence in Phoenix Park on Saturday, an opportunity for approximately 40 youth from area schools to take part in a five-on-five NFL Flag Football Tournament. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Steelers President Art Rooney II and Steelers Vice President of Business Development & Strategy Dan Rooney were in attendance for the fun-filled afternoon, which included gift exchanges with U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Edward Walsh. Ben Roethlisberger, Maurkice Pouncey and Ike Taylor were all on hand to provide instruction and encouragement for the youth. **Town Hall Forum & Pittsburgh Reception** Later in the day on Saturday, Art Rooney II",

Against the Vikings in Dublin, Herbig's third-and-12 sack in the second quarter set up Aaron Rodgers' 80-yard TD pass to DK Metcalf that sent the Steelers off and running. To seal the win, Herbig pressured QB Carson Wentz into an intentional grounding penalty that lost 16 yards (and 10 seconds). The Vikings couldn't recover from second-and-26 and the Steelers improved to 3-1. \"Nick's a good football player. That's just what he is. He can do everything,\" Martin said. \"People like to think he's just a pass guy, but if you watch the tape from this past week, he was (defending) run, pass, anything we needed him to be – special teams, you know what I mean? He just does it all. He's just gonna continue to get better every week.\" At 240 pounds, Herbig's game is based more off quickness than size. But according to Martin – who took over the OLB coaching position the same year Herbig was drafted – Herbig's run defense has improved significantly. Martin was asked how that development occurred. \"Just the constant stuff we do in individual every day,\" Martin said. \"We're on the sleds, putting our hands on people, using our hands, releasing off people, and making plays. I just think he continually does that each week and he puts it on tape.\" Watt and Herbig, both from the University of Wisconsin, have 5.5 of the Steelers' 14 sacks. Extrapolated out over 17 games, those 14 sacks would become 59.5, enough to break the team record of 56 set in both the 2017 and 2020 seasons that were 16 games in length. The \"Blitzburgh\" defense of 1994 had 55 sacks. \"We just like to get after the passer,\" Martin said. \"Blitzes sometimes get us our one-on-ones and the things that we want and help us get to the passer easier. \"It's all exciting. That's Blitzburgh. That's what I've known since I've been here.

When they deactivated running back Jaylen Warren in advance of last Sunday's meeting with the Vikings in Dublin, the Steelers knew they'd have to replace their leading rusher and leading receiver through the season's first three weeks. They also knew what they had in running back Kenneth Gainwell. With Warren and his 132 rushing yards and 142 receiving yards sidelined due to a knee injury, Gainwell responded with a career day in the Steelers' 24-21 victory. Gainwell's 19 carries constituted a career-high total, as did his 99 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. His 5.2-yard average per carry was the second-highest he'd achieved in a game in which he'd been asked to carry the ball at least 10 times. Gainwell also had six catches on six targets for 35 receiving yards. His signature series in the estimation of running backs coach Eddie Faulkner was the five-play, 35-yard drive that produced a touchdown and a 21-6 Steelers' lead with 2:23 left in the third quarter. The possession commenced after an interception and 13-yard return by outside linebacker T.J. Watt. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers hit tight end Darnell Washington for 8 yards to start the march. After that, Gainwell carried for gains of 7, 6, 10 and 4 yards on the way to the end zone. \"You know, that drive, we went down and scored after T.J.'s interception, (Gainwell) was doing a really good job of controlling the game,\" Faulkner said. \"You saw some patience come out on him. Whether it was gap-scheme or zone-scheme he was being patient, letting the blocks develop for him and then bursting through the hole. \"That was a really good series to see where he kind of took the game over.

In [1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"), the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7–3 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the [2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005%E2%80%9306_NFL_playoffs#AFC:_Pittsburgh_Steelers_31,_Cincinnati_Bengals_17 \"2005–06 NFL playoffs\"), in which the Steelers, en route to a [Super Bowl title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XL \"Super Bowl XL\"), won a 31–17 come-from-behind victory after [Bengals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals \"Cincinnati Bengals\") quarterback [Carson Palmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Palmer \"Carson Palmer\") was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle [Kimo von Oelhoffen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimo_von_Oelhoffen \"Kimo von Oelhoffen\") contacted Palmer's knee during a passing play.[\\[114\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-115) The Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit. The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") season 38–31, and wide receiver [T. J.

The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in [2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") and taking them out of contention in [2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2006 Pittsburgh Steelers season\"). The rivalry has become more intense again since the [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2015 Pittsburgh Steelers season\") season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker [Vontaze Burfict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vontaze_Burfict \"Vontaze Burfict\"), often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18–16 Steelers comeback victory.[\\[61\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-ChrisBurke-61) The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63–35.[\\[115\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-116) The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times.[\\[116\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-117) ### Conference #### New England Patriots Main article: [Patriots–Steelers rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriots%E2%80%93Steelers_rivalry \"Patriots–Steelers rivalry\") The [New England Patriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots \"New England Patriots\") emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 [AFC Championship Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game \"AFC Championship Game\") at [Heinz Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz_Field \"Heinz Field\"), though the",

This year, through the offseason and training camp, he was able to build a bond with them that continues to grow. \"I think Latrobe was awesome this year to spend time with the guys,\" said Skowronek. \"I didn't have that luxury last year. I came in week one, I think I got here on Tuesday and played on Sunday and didn't know the guys' names. My number one priority was learning the playbook. \"But this year I was able to spend all offseason with the guys. Obviously, in Latrobe, there's not much to do out there besides hang out with the guys. Football is a lot more than just X's and O's. It's a relationship game. You've got to be able to trust the guy next to you. You've got to be able to trust the coaches. I think that comes with not only playing together, but hanging out outside practice, outside the facility. That's what I felt like this offseason I accomplished the most. I've got a lot of close friends on the team now, just spending the nights together in Latrobe, hanging out, talking. Getting to know each other outside the game, and that just builds trust.\" **Miller waiting for his time:** When receiver/punt returner Calvin Austin III suffered a shoulder injury against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday at Dublin's Croke Park, Scotty Miller knew he had to be on alert. Miller is not just solid depth at the receiver position, but he is also Austin's backup as a punt returner. While Miller was ready to go, the Vikings were playing from behind and didn't punt the remainder of the game. However, if he is needed moving forward due to Austin's injury, Miller is ready to roll. \"I was going to be there at the end of the game,\" said Miller. \"But we didn't have any opportunities. I didn't think there really would be, just because I know they needed to score a lot of points to",

When they deactivated running back Jaylen Warren in advance of last Sunday's meeting with the Vikings in Dublin, the Steelers knew they'd have to replace their leading rusher and leading receiver through the season's first three weeks. They also knew what they had in running back Kenneth Gainwell. With Warren and his 132 rushing yards and 142 receiving yards sidelined due to a knee injury, Gainwell responded with a career day in the Steelers' 24-21 victory. Gainwell's 19 carries constituted a career-high total, as did his 99 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. His 5.2-yard average per carry was the second-highest he'd achieved in a game in which he'd been asked to carry the ball at least 10 times. Gainwell also had six catches on six targets for 35 receiving yards. His signature series in the estimation of running backs coach Eddie Faulkner was the five-play, 35-yard drive that produced a touchdown and a 21-6 Steelers' lead with 2:23 left in the third quarter. The possession commenced after an interception and 13-yard return by outside linebacker T.J. Watt. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers hit tight end Darnell Washington for 8 yards to start the march. After that, Gainwell carried for gains of 7, 6, 10 and 4 yards on the way to the end zone. \"You know, that drive, we went down and scored after T.J.'s interception, (Gainwell) was doing a really good job of controlling the game,\" Faulkner said. \"You saw some patience come out on him.

Pickett gave the offense a bit of a spark, but also made some rookie mistakes, as the Steelers fell, 24-20, to the New York Jets here at Acrisure Stadium. Trubisky was 7 of 13 for 84 yards and a tipped interception, but had led the Steelers (1-3) to just six points in the first half as they trailed 10-6. He also was sacked three times. Pickett finished 10 of 13 for 120 yards but three interceptions. He also scored a pair of rushing touchdowns to help set up a day in which the Steelers rushed for 119 yards, including a season-high 74 on 18 carries for Najee Harris. \"We just thought we needed a spark,\" Tomlin said. \"We didn't do much in the first half, not enough offensively, and thought he could provide a spark for us.\" # [GAME PHOTOS: Week 4 vs. Jets](https://www.steelers.com/photos/game-photos-week-4-vs-jets) Game action photos from the Steelers' Week 4 game against the New York Jets at Acrisure Stadium 1 / 123 Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Myles Jack (51) during a regular season game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New York Jets, Sunday, Oct. 2, 2022 in Pittsburgh, PA.

It marked the third consecutive game in which the Steelers blocked a kick, tying a team record for most blocks in consecutive games and blocks in a single season. _Week 8, 4:58 3rd quarter, against New York Giants_ The Steelers were locked in a 9-9 tie with the visiting Giants when an Alex Highsmith sack helped force New York to punt. Austin fielded the punt at his own 27 on the right hash, cut all the way back across the field, picking up a block on the edge from Rodney Williams and sprinted up the sideline for a 73-yard punt return touchdown.

But with the Giants at the 19, Watt whipped his block at the snap, hit quarterback Daniel Jones and forced him to fumble, recovering the loose ball himself. The Steelers would run the clock down to two minutes while moving out to midfield before punting. And Bishop would record his third interception in two weeks in the closing seconds to seal the win for the Steelers. ## Related Content [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/rj2x6jlmd2sgprf4yxxo.jpg)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Winning while building**\\\\ \\\\ The Steelers head into their bye week with a 3-1 record](https://www.steelers.com/news/winning-while-building \"Winning while building\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/i7btzicosviyf83wurca.png)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Brandin Echols**\\\\ \\\\ Learn more about Brandin Echols in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-brandin-echols \"Five Fast Facts: Brandin Echols\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/hxpq5fwt6jwfdmbzs7m5.png)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Darius Slay**\\\\ \\\\ Learn more about Darius Slay in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-darius-slay \"Five Fast Facts: Darius Slay\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/gfbre5360twmbebktymu.png)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Kaleb Johnson**\\\\ \\\\ Learn more about Kaleb Johnson in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-kaleb-johnson \"Five Fast Facts: Kaleb Johnson\") [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **The voice of experience**\\\\ \\\\ Seumalo's play, presence counted upon to steady youngsters up front](https://www.steelers.com/news/the-voice-of-experience \"The voice of experience\") [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Malik Harrison**\\\\",

The Steelers head into their bye week at 6-2 and in first place in the AFC North. How they have gotten to this point has been an interesting dichotomy of today's NFL. During a three-game winning streak to open the season, the defense was dominant, allowing just 26 total points. During a two-game losing streak, the defense, which had been the backbone of the winning streak to open the season, showed some leakage, giving up 27 and 20 points, too many for a team playing with its backup quarterback, as the Steelers were to open the season. But during a three-game winning streak heading into the bye week, the offense, defense and special teams have all played in unison. That has led to some lopsided scores and the 6-2 record that has Steelers sitting atop the division, a position the team will hold when it next plays Nov. 10 at Washington regardless of what happens this weekend. And the Steelers have gotten there despite a number of injuries that could have sent the team into a spiral. To wit, the offensive line has had four different players make their first career NFL start and has utilized five different starting combinations because of a number of injuries up front. Add to that games missed by, among others, outside linebackers Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig and running backs Jaylen Warren and Cordarrelle Patterson, let alone quarterback Russell Wilson missing the first six games of the season with a calf injury, and the it would be more understandable that the Steelers would be 2-6 instead of 6-2. With Wilson injured, Justin Fields started the Steelers' first six games and helped the team to a 4-2 start, showing that the team's deft handling of the makeover of its quarterback room from 2023 was well worth the gamble. Fields, just 10-28 as a starter in Chicago, accounted for 10 touchdowns and two turnovers in his six starts, while Wilson has thrown for three scores and rushed for another in his two starts. The acquisition of those two quarterbacks – along with third-stringer Kyle Allen – were just three of the offseason moves made by GM Omar Khan. And all of his moves have largely paid dividends in the first half of the season. Cornerback Donte Jackson, linebacker Patrick Queen and safety DeShon Elliott all have been major additions to the defense. So, too, has been third-round draft pick Payton Wilson at linebacker. On the offensive side of things, first-round pick Troy Fautanu was unfortunately injured after making his first career start, but second-round selection Zach Frazier has arguably been the NFL's best rookie offensive lineman before missing the past two games with an ankle injury. He is expected to return after the bye week. Meanwhile, fourth-round selection Mason McCormick has moved into the starting lineup at right guard in place of an injured James",

        "text": "Unlike most other private landowners, the museum is willing to leave money on the ground, so to speak, forgoing revenue from logging in the name of science. And in 2008, the reserve conducted a landscape survey of its forests—which includes 45 species of trees—so researchers know the measurements of the forest prior to the wind damage, an incredibly helpful and highly unusual bonus. “Timber can be very valuable, so loggers and the Forestry Service see it as an important resource going to waste if you leave it on the ground,” says Carson. “The counterargument from ecologists is that downed logs contain vital nutrients for the soil; that salvaging trees and creating a flat landscape disturbs habitats for birds and other animals. Both schools of thought depend on your \\[college\\] degree. What is needed is good science to resolve debate.” After all, the country needs wood products, he says, and millions of acres of land is salvaged, or cleared of fallen timber, across the country each year. If science can help inform best practices, it would be a significant win-win. One important question researchers want to answer is whether a salvaged or unsalvaged forest will lead to greater rejuvenation, and what species will grow back? When many trees are downed due to a tornado, the increased light at ground level can lead to the rapid growth of plants that would struggle under the shade of a forest’s canopy. But is it possible that timber left on the ground will inhibit such growth, physically obstructing its development? Or, could the difficulty of walking through an often dangerous, maze-like mess of fallen trees inhibit deer foraging, giving some plants more of a chance to survive where they would have had little or no chance in a cleared forest? “That’s what makes this study so unique and the most complete of its kind—that we’ll study the impact of deer browsing along with the impact of salvaging and the impact of the understory, all simultaneously,” Carson says. The pair, in partnership with researchers from Ohio State, Penn State, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, University of Vermont, Virginia Tech, and Susquehanna University, expect to have initial findings within two or three years. But they plan to keep the experiment running for at least a decade in hopes that it will become a landmark location of forest recovery that’s reexamined for 50 years or more. James Whitacre, the reserve’s GIS manager, gets a bird’s eye view to document the experiments. To perform their experiments, the team will begin by using two 10-acre sections that are in close proximity to each other and of similar makeup—both important controls. Half of each will be salvaged. Equal parts of both the salvaged and unsalvaged areas will then be fitted with deer exclusion fences. And finally, in half of each deer-excluded area, the low-lying, deer-tolerant forest cover known as the understory will be removed, giving all plants across the test areas equal footing to grow. Then the team will replicate the experiments. What do they expect to find? “Our prediction is that the best way",

Pittsburgh sits at a unique confluence of rivers unlike any other in the world, diverse and more abundant than any other state except Alaska. The three rivers that meet in Pittsburgh are actually a vast watershed of more than a dozen unique creeks and river systems that include more than 30,000 miles of rivers and streams extending into New York and West Virginia. These clean and accessible waters have become a stunning icon of Pittsburgh's environmental transformation. ## Kayaking, Paddling & Rowing Pittsburgh's rivers are ideal for sculling, kayaking and canoeing. The [Three Rivers Water Trail System](http://www.friendsoftheriverfront.org/ \"Three Rivers Water Trail System\") is a project intended to develop the rivers as recreational waterways with convenient access points and day-use sites; the Allegheny River Trail is already complete. On the Allegheny River in the heart of [Downtown Pittsburgh](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/downtown-pittsburgh/), [Kayak Pittsburgh](https://ventureoutdoors.org/kayak-pittsburgh/ \"Kayak Pittsburgh\") rents solo and tandem kayaks, canoes, and hydrobikes for peaceful urban exploration. Located under the 31st Street Bridge on the [North Shore](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/north-shore-north-side/), the [Three Rivers Rowing Association](http://www.threeriversrowing.org/ \"Three Rivers Rowing Association\") offers rowing, kayaking, and dragon boating to individuals, schools and organizations of all skill levels. The [Steel City Rowing Club](http://www.steelcityrowing.org/ \"Steel City Rowing Club\") is the only rowing organization on the upper Allegheny River, which boasts nine full miles of rowing without locks or dams, on relatively undeveloped wetlands. ## Boating Pittsburgh has the second-largest number of registered pleasure boats in the country. There are [seventeen marinas](http://www.fish.state.pa.us/marinas.htm \"Seventeen Marinas\") in Allegheny County along the three rivers, offering river access, dining and boat maintenance. [Station Square](http://www.stationsquare.com/ \"Station Square\") in the [South Side](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/south-side/) offers public docks at Bessemer Court, for easy river access to downtown shopping and dining. Also within the city limits are four [public boat launches](http://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Portals/72/docs/Recreation/BOAT%20LAUNCHING%20RAMPS.pdf \"Public Boat Launches\"), one on the Monongahela River in the South Side and three along the Allegheny River Trail. Visitors can rent kayaks and boats at the North Park Boathouse through [Venture Outdoors](http://www.ventureoutdoors.org/). ## Fishing There are 38.3 miles of river shoreline within the city limits. [Venture Outdoors](http://www.ventureoutdoors.org/ \"Venture Outdoors\") organizes weekly lunchtime fishing in [Point State Park](http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/point/ \"link to Point State Park website\") or [North Shore Riverfront Park](http://www.pgh-sea.com/northshoreriverfrontpark.htm \"North Shore Riverfront Park\"), with an instructor on hand to help the novice and expert alike. Regionally, western Pennsylvania's [state parks](http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/ \"State Parks\") abound with well-stocked lakes and streams. Deer Lakes Park and North Park both have [accessible fishing piers](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Parks-and-Events/Activities/Fishing). ## Whitewater In [Ohiopyle State Park](http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/ \"Ohiopyle State Park\"), the Youghiogheny River boasts class III and IV rapids and is considered to be some of the best whitewater in the east.

Lithograph by [Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_Mortimer_Fowler \"Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler\"). The **history of Pittsburgh** began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh \"Pittsburgh\") region, known as _Jaödeogë’_ in the [Seneca language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_language \"Seneca language\").[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Pittsburgh#cite_note-Chafe2013-1) Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the [Allegheny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_River \"Allegheny River\") and [Monongahela Rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monongahela_River \"Monongahela River\") meet to form the [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_River \"Ohio River\"), which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_France \"Kingdom of France\") and [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain \"Kingdom of Great Britain\") [fought for control in the 1750s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War \"French and Indian War\"). When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi. Following [American independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War \"American Revolutionary War\") in 1783, the village around [Fort Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pitt_(Pennsylvania) \"Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)\") continued to grow. The region saw the short-lived [Whiskey Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion \"Whiskey Rebellion\"), when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\") cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the [Allegheny Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_Mountains \"Allegheny Mountains\"). Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 [railway riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Railway_Riots \"Pittsburgh Railway Riots\") it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the [nationwide strikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Railroad_Strike_of_1877 \"Great Railroad Strike of 1877\") of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel. Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States \"Great Depression in the United States\"), the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the [New Deal Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal_Coalition \"New Deal Coalition\") under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the \" [Arsenal of Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_of_Democracy \"Arsenal of Democracy\")\", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned. Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance\". The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the [Pittsburgh metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_metropolitan_area \"Pittsburgh metropolitan area\") is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities. ## Native American era \\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Native American era\")\\] [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/NativeTowns_Pittsburgh.png/500px-NativeTowns_Pittsburgh.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NativeTowns_Pittsburgh.png) Native Americans lived near the forks of the Ohio for thousands of years.

On March 13, 2007, Pennsylvania's governor [Ed Rendell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Rendell \"Ed Rendell\"), [Allegheny County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania \"Allegheny County, Pennsylvania\") chief executive [Dan Onorato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Onorato \"Dan Onorato\"), Pittsburgh's mayor [Luke Ravenstahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Ravenstahl \"Luke Ravenstahl\") and Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long-sought arena. The completion of [Consol Energy Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Paints_Arena \"PPG Paints Arena\") guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325 million [bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance) \"Bond (finance)\") was issued, and the Penguins signed a 30-year [lease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lease \"Lease\") on September 19, binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040.[\\[35\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-35) After a mediocre start to the [2007–08 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_NHL_season \"2007–08 NHL season\"), Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin. On April 2, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title – their first division title in 10 years – with a 4–2 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the [Hart Memorial Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_Memorial_Trophy \"Hart Memorial Trophy\"). The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4–0, defeating the New York Rangers 4–1 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4–1 to clinch the [Prince of Wales Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales_Trophy \"Prince of Wales Trophy\"). Pittsburgh lost the [2008 Stanley Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Stanley_Cup_Final \"2008 Stanley Cup Final\") to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14–6 record. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying [Conn Smythe Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conn_Smythe_Trophy \"Conn Smythe Trophy\")-winner [Henrik Zetterberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Zetterberg \"Henrik Zetterberg\") (13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead.

He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoon [Ronald Burkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Burkle \"Ronald Burkle\")) assumed control on September 3, 1999, saving the franchise for the second time.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-History2016-6) Lemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player–owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the [2001 playoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Stanley_Cup_playoffs \"2001 Stanley Cup playoffs\"), highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in game 7 of the second round.

The Penguins' attendance had dwindled in the late 1990s. In 1998–99, the club had an average attendance of 14,825 at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year.[\\[19\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-attendance-19) Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_NHL_season \"2001–02 NHL season\"), finishing in a tie for third-to-last in their conference.

This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, with the team winning just 23 games. As in the 1980s, the Penguins' struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL entry draft classes that would yield multiple world-class talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the [2004 NHL entry draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_NHL_entry_draft \"2004 NHL entry draft\") ( [Alexander Ovechkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Ovechkin \"Alexander Ovechkin\")), which went to the Washington Capitals.

However, their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, defeated the highly favored Penguins in six games.[\\[40\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins#cite_note-40) Malkin was later awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy and [Lester B.

Starting in the spring, Peters will teach an introduction to museums course at Pitt, using the four Carnegie Museums as a living laboratory. She’ll also supervise a small team of student interns working across the museums. “Because Carnegie Museums includes four distinct museums with different holdings and ways of operating, it’s the perfect model,” says Peters. “We’ll explore what is typically an art museum and how does Carnegie Museum of Art navigate that; and what is typically a natural history museum and how does Carnegie Museum of Natural History navigate that, and so on. How do we work together in this sort of older model of classification and separation and move beyond it to connection?” Consider, for example, Egyptian art and artifacts. Even though the objects are from the same location and same time period, notes Peters, Carnegie Museums houses the ancient treasures in two different museums—which share a building—and they’re displayed in completely different ways. “We’ll talk about what this tells us about museums and how they communicate messages,” says Peters. “How display lighting, what museums call objects, and how much information you put around objects creates an idea of what those objects are.” It’s likely the students will even help the museum prototype elements of exhibitions, bringing the visitor into the process from the start, says Peters. As these kinds of relationships continue to build—among the museums and between the museums and other organizations, such as Pitt—it’s all about changing the conversation, Parker says. “These catalyst positions haven’t been created so much to do something for us as to influence and shape the way we do most things we do.” Also in this issue: The Elevation of Everyday Design · Taking its Bow · Art of the Now · Inside the Cloud Factory · President’s Note · NewsWorthy · Artistic License: In Full Light · Travel Log · The Big Picture Copyright © 2017 CARNEGIE Magazine.

The company was founded by five women who established the Pittsburgh Opera Society in 1939, making possible the inaugural performance of [Offenbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Offenbach \"Jacques Offenbach\")'s _[Les Contes d'Hoffmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Contes_d%27Hoffmann \"Les Contes d'Hoffmann\")_ at the [Carnegie Music Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Music_Hall \"Carnegie Music Hall\") in March 1940.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-3) The first director of the company was Richard Karp, from 1942 to 1977. His daughter Barbara Karp took over her father's duties during his final illness. James DeBlasis then served as interim artistic director after the resignation of Barbara Karp.

When Rodolfo, a poet, and Mimì, a young seamstress, meet, the two are drawn into a tumultuous and passionate affair with a love that can only be broken by death. La Bohème will make you laugh, and bring you to tears, with its timeless story and captivating music. Emotional and dramatic, it’s no wonder Puccini’s most celebrated opera has transcended the genre, inspiring both a ballet and the Broadway hit musical RENT. Antony Walker conducts; Kristine McIntyre directs. _These performances are sponsored in part by generous gifts from The Gailliot Fund and Drs. Athan and Lydia Georgiades.

The most famous of these is probably [Myron Cope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Cope \"Myron Cope\"), who served as a Steelers radio [color commentator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator \"Color commentator\") for 35 seasons ( [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"1970 Pittsburgh Steelers season\")– [2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Pittsburgh_Steelers_season \"2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season\")).[\\[223\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-n230-224) Several former Steelers players have gone on to careers in media after completing their playing careers. ### Newspaper The _Steelers Digest_ is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers.[\\[224\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-i972-225) It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season.

        "text": "- MOBILE TICKET BARCODE #### What is a Mobile Ticket Barcode? Each ticket has a mobile ticket barcode that must be scanned for entry into PNC Park via your mobile device. Within the Wallet, you can tap on an individual ticket to view its barcode. For entry to PNC Park, present your mobile device with the mobile barcode open and available to scan. #### How do I access the ticket to scan for entry? Tap on an individual ticket from the Tickets tab’s Wallet to pull up the mobile ticket barcode. The Section/Row/Seat and barcode will be displayed along with access to the terms and conditions governing your ticket. #### Why is my ticket barcode not showing in the MLB Ballpark app? There are several reasons why your barcode may not be available including that the ticket has been forwarded, the ticket had been forwarded to you and has since been canceled or recalled, or you are a group or suite buyer and the ticket status has changed. For mailed tickets, the ticket barcode will not appear until those tickets have been printed and mailed to you. For further assistance, contact Pirates Fans Services at [ticketservices@pirates.com](mailto:ticketservices@pirates.com) or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. #### I just forwarded a ticket via the MLB Ballpark app. Why do I still see it? Your ticket, without the barcode, will remain in your Tickets tab’s Wallet until your forward is accepted by the recipient. If you wish to cancel the forward, you can do that directly from the ticket. #### During what window of time can I forward tickets to friends? You can forward tickets via the MLB Ballpark app from the moment you purchase them until two hours after the first pitch of that day's game as long as that ticket has not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park. #### What should I do if I need to enter PNC Park for the start of the game and the rest of my group is not here yet? You can easily forward tickets to friends via the MLB Ballpark app up to two hours after the start of that day's game as long as the tickets have not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park. #### Can I use Apple Wallet for my Pirates tickets? Yes. From the bottom of the ticket inside the MLB Ballpark app you can tap the \"Add to Wallet\" button to add your ticket to Apple Wallet. #### Can I use Google Pay for my Pirates tickets? No. Support for adding tickets to Google Pay is not yet available from the MLB Ballpark app. #### Why won't my ticket barcode scan? If your screen brightness is too low, the barcode may have difficulty being scanned. The MLB Ballpark app will automatically attempt to increase the brightness of your display or you can do so manually by following the instructions for your device. Please note, cracked screens may impact your barcode's ability to scan. The barcode displayed is accompanied by a number. If there are difficulties reading a valid barcode on a",

        "text": "# First half of Steelers' season loaded with memorable plays Nov 01, 2024 at 12:00 PM [Dale Lolley](https://www.steelers.com/author/dale-lolley) Contributing Writer/Editor [Opens Twitter profile page in new window - Opens new window](https://twitter.com/dlolley_pgh) - Copied! The Steelers head into their bye week at 6-2 and in first place in the AFC North. How they have gotten to this point has been an interesting dichotomy of today's NFL. During a three-game winning streak to open the season, the defense was dominant, allowing just 26 total points. During a two-game losing streak, the defense, which had been the backbone of the winning streak to open the season, showed some leakage, giving up 27 and 20 points, too many for a team playing with its backup quarterback, as the Steelers were to open the season. But during a three-game winning streak heading into the bye week, the offense, defense and special teams have all played in unison. That has led to some lopsided scores and the 6-2 record that has Steelers sitting atop the division, a position the team will hold when it next plays Nov. 10 at Washington regardless of what happens this weekend. And the Steelers have gotten there despite a number of injuries that could have sent the team into a spiral. To wit, the offensive line has had four different players make their first career NFL start and has utilized five different starting combinations because of a number of injuries up front. Add to that games missed by, among others, outside linebackers Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig and running backs Jaylen Warren and Cordarrelle Patterson, let alone quarterback Russell Wilson missing the first six games of the season with a calf injury, and the it would be more understandable that the Steelers would be 2-6 instead of 6-2. With Wilson injured, Justin Fields started the Steelers' first six games and helped the team to a 4-2 start, showing that the team's deft handling of the makeover of its quarterback room from 2023 was well worth the gamble. Fields, just 10-28 as a starter in Chicago, accounted for 10 touchdowns and two turnovers in his six starts, while Wilson has thrown for three scores and rushed for another in his two starts. The acquisition of those two quarterbacks – along with third-stringer Kyle Allen – were just three of the offseason moves made by GM Omar Khan. And all of his moves have largely paid dividends in the first half of the season. Cornerback Donte Jackson, linebacker Patrick Queen and safety DeShon Elliott all have been major additions to the defense. So, too, has been third-round draft pick Payton Wilson at linebacker. On the offensive side of things, first-round pick Troy Fautanu was unfortunately injured after making his first career start, but second-round selection Zach Frazier has arguably been the NFL's best rookie offensive lineman before missing the past two games with an ankle injury. He is expected to return after the bye week. Meanwhile, fourth-round selection Mason McCormick has moved into the starting lineup at right guard in place of an injured James",

That gave Beanie Bishop the opportunity to step underneath Garrett Wilson and intercept the pass at the Pittsburgh 46. Four plays later, Russell Wilson tossed an 11-yard TD to George Pickens, cutting New York's lead to 15-13 and starting a run of 31 consecutive points for the Steelers.

But Greg Zuerlein's attempt was blocked by defensive lineman Dean Lowry, turning the Jets away without points. It marked the third consecutive game in which the Steelers blocked a kick, tying a team record for most blocks in consecutive games and blocks in a single season. _Week 8, 4:58 3rd quarter, against New York Giants_ The Steelers were locked in a 9-9 tie with the visiting Giants when an Alex Highsmith sack helped force New York to punt. Austin fielded the punt at his own 27 on the right hash, cut all the way back across the field, picking up a block on the edge from Rodney Williams and sprinted up the sideline for a 73-yard punt return touchdown. It was the Steelers' first punt return for a score since 2019. On the Steelers' next possession, Austin would catch a 29-yard touchdown pass from Wilson, helping the Steelers to their sixth win. _Week 8, 3:03 4th quarter, against New York Giants_ With the Steelers leading 26-18, Wilson fumbled on a scramble, with the Giants recovering at the Pittsburgh 37. But with the Giants at the 19, Watt whipped his block at the snap, hit quarterback Daniel Jones and forced him to fumble, recovering the loose ball himself. The Steelers would run the clock down to two minutes while moving out to midfield before punting. And Bishop would record his third interception in two weeks in the closing seconds to seal the win for the Steelers. ## Related Content [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/rj2x6jlmd2sgprf4yxxo.jpg)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Winning while building**\\\\ \\\\ The Steelers head into their bye week with a 3-1 record](https://www.steelers.com/news/winning-while-building \"Winning while building\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/i7btzicosviyf83wurca.png)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Brandin Echols**\\\\ \\\\ Learn more about Brandin Echols in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-brandin-echols \"Five Fast Facts: Brandin Echols\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/hxpq5fwt6jwfdmbzs7m5.png)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Darius Slay**\\\\ \\\\ Learn more about Darius Slay in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-darius-slay \"Five Fast Facts: Darius Slay\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/gfbre5360twmbebktymu.png)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Kaleb Johnson**\\\\ \\\\ Learn more about Kaleb Johnson in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-kaleb-johnson \"Five Fast Facts: Kaleb Johnson\") [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **The voice of experience**\\\\ \\\\ Seumalo's play, presence counted upon to steady youngsters up front](https://www.steelers.com/news/the-voice-of-experience \"The voice of experience\") [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Malik Harrison**\\\\",

        "text": "# Winning while building Oct 04, 2025 at 09:00 AM [Jim Wexell](https://www.steelers.com/author/jim-wexell) Correspondent - Copied! Winning while building. That's a view of the Steelers season after four games. It's both apt and optimistic for a 3-1 team that saw a 50 percent turnover of the players (who comprised the top 13 amount of snaps on both sides of the ball) in the 2024 and 2025 openers. Fifty percent turnover is a massive change. And the turnover from 2024 playoff lineup to 2025 opener was 38 percent, still a sizable turnover. For a coach whose goal of the preseason was to get his players to \"the starting line\" in good health, the building -- the true team building -- didn't begin until the regular season did. And the Steelers have obviously improved from Week One to Week Four, when the sizable import of new players began to settle in. The Steelers entered their bye week at 3-1 with road wins against two AFC opponents. The fact they rank 29th in offense and 28th in defense offers promise that so much improvement is yet to occur. How did they do it? Well, their \"turnover culture\" is alive and well. The Steelers are second in the NFL with a +7 margin in turnovers, much of that due to a third-place standing in total sacks with 14. They are also seventh in red zone TD percentage, so they not only get extra chances with turnovers, they take advantage with touchdowns. Individually, only Aaron Rodgers has a top-10 spot in key rankings. The Steelers' new QB is fourth with 8 TD passes and ninth with a 102.6 passer rating. But statistics don't tell the story of \"winning while building\" at 3-1. The highlights have kept Steelers Nation on the edge of its collective seat throughout the first quarter of the season. Here's a game-by-game look at the best of the first four games: **Steelers 34, Jets 32** \\- First TD of the season a play-action, roll right pass from Rodgers to a wide open Ben Skowronek. \\- Chris Boswell kicked field goals of 56 and a team-record 60 yards, the latter turning out to be the game-winner with 1:03 remaining. \\- On a late-game fourth-and-3 for the Jets, Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey drilled Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson to jar the ball loose and seal the Steelers' win. # [PHOTOS: Karl's top pics - Steelers at Jets](https://www.steelers.com/photos/photos-karl-s-top-pics-steelers-at-jets-x8049) Take a look at Karl's best photos from the Week 1 matchup against the New York Jets 1 / 81 Pittsburgh Steelers running back Kaleb Johnson (20) prior to a regular season game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New York Jets, Sunday, Sept. 7, 2025 in East Rutherford, NJ.

        "text": "# Meadowcroft Rockshelter\n\nDig into archaeological evidence that reveals the earliest signs of human habitation dating back 19,000 years.\n\nIf not for the curiosity of a Washington County, Pa., farmer six decades ago, Meadowcroft Rockshelter – the oldest site of human habitation in North America – might have never been discovered. In 1955, Albert Miller stumbled upon a groundhog hole on his family’s farm in Avella and uncovered what looked to be a prehistoric tool.\n\nMiller chose to cover up the hole and carefully search for a professional archeologist who could properly assess the historical significance of the site. Almost two decades later in 1973, Miller finally connected with University of Pittsburgh anthropology professor Dr. James Adovasio who visited the farm and looked at the object found near the groundhog hole.\n\nAstonished by the artifact, which was a prehistoric flint knife, Dr. Adovasio assembled a team of archaeology, anthropology and geology students to study the area as part of a curriculum. The field school’s excavation of the site over the next six years yielded nearly two million artifacts and ecofacts, including ancient stone tools, pottery fragments, and evidence of ice-age fire pits.\n\nFurther testing of the newly found artifacts concluded that the rock ledge overhang – naturally formed by the waters of Cross Creek – served as a campsite for prehistoric hunters and gatherers 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter provided shelter for visitors with nearby fresh water springs and sources of plants and animals for food.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior designated Meadowcroft Rockshelter a National Historic Landmark.\n\nDiscover this important archeological treasure for yourself and visit Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. Tours of the Rockshelter are available during regular operating hours and begin in the Meadowcroft visitor center.\n\n**During Meadowcroft’s open season, daily tours of the Rockshelter begin at the Visitors Center. Tour times vary and last approximately one hour.**\n\nFor information about scheduling and reservations, please contact Meadowcroft at 724-587-3412 or meadowcroftinfo@heinzhistorycenter.org.\n\n## Explore the Rockshelter\n\nVirtual Exhibit\n\nMeadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village\n\nThis GigaPan is a series of interactive images that allows anyone to explore the Meadowcroft Rockshelter archaeological site from any computer. This project was made possible through the generous support of the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation, and through partnership with Carnegie Mellon University’s CREATE Lab and Learning Media Design Center.\n\n[View the GigaPan](https://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/meadowcroft-gigapan)",

Visit the Fort Pitt Block House, Frick Building and many more during your visit. ## Downtown ### Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail Complex Stunningly beautiful. Singularly graceful. A symphony of arches. Considered by many to be the leading architect of the 19th century, Henry Hobson Richardson's 19th century neo-medieval design combines stunning brickwork and crisp granite detail. An outdoor fountain in the courtyard park highlights the magnificent riverfront structure, while the Bridge of Sighs (mirroring the Venice original) --at one time used to transport prisoners--connects the Courthouse to the former jail. What Richardson considered his best work remains among elite architectural company in Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle. ### BNY Mellon Born out of a merger between The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation, The Bank of New York Mellon has a substantial Pittsburgh presence. It's the oldest banking corporation in the nation - tracing its roots back to Alexander Hamilton. BNY Mellon Center is 55 stories and was completed in 1983. It is the second-tallest building in the city, boasts an eight-sided design and a rooftop heliport. On a clear day it is possible to spot the building from as far as 50 miles away. ### Fort Pitt Block House The Block House is the oldest structure in the City of Pittsburgh and the last vestige of the British Empire, built here in 1764 by the English Army. Much of its original fabric is still intact and it is open and free to the public year-round as an historic landmark. The Block House is the focal point in Point State Park where the three rivers of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny, the Ohio and the Monongahela, meet. ### Frick Building The Frick Building (1901-02), the first of industrialist Henry Clay Frick's architectural ventures on Grant Street, Downtown. In 1903, Leslie's Weekly judged it \"the finest office building in the world,\" and no wonder: Daniel Burnham gave the coke and steel king a vertical version of the White City, a neo-classical tower with a dazzling white, T-shaped marble lobby, clean and crisp as a new dollar bill; bronze lions flanking the entrance; and John La Farge's stained glass window, \"Fortune and Her Wheel,\" above a marble bust of Frick installed after his death in 1919. ### Fifth Avenue Place Home to Highmark, Pennsylvania's largest health insurer, Fifth Avenue Place was completed in 1988 and has 31 floors. The structure is made of a unique granite frame for roughly 450 feet and then collapses inward in a pyramid shape for another 124-foot-tall roof structure. Protruding from the top of the skyscraper is a 178-foot-tall mast. Despite its rounded appearance, the 13-story structure is actually 12-sided and measures four feet in diameter. ### Gulf Tower Rising 44 stories above the Downtown skyline,",

Step inside, walk to the center and look up into the delicate lace of the stained glass dome. ### U.S. Steel Tower Designed by Harrison & Abramovitz, the world headquarters of the U.S. Steel Corporation was completed in 1971. During the initial planning stages, the U.S. Steel Corporation seriously considered making this development the world's tallest building. The tower's shape, mirroring the shape of Downtown Pittsburgh, is a triangle with indented corners. It was the first building to use liquid-fireproofed columns. At the time of its completion this was the world's tallest building outside of New York and Chicago, and is still the tallest building in Pittsburgh at 64 stories. When its construction was completed in 1971, the building was considered to be an engineering masterpiece. The Tower is home to the global headquarters for both the U.S. Steel Corporation and UPMC, a leader in innovative health care practices and a health insurance provider. ## Mt. Washington ### Chatham Village Built in the early 1930s, Chatham Village is a model planned community with rowhouses, garden courts, greenbelt and recreation facilities opened through the Buhl Foundation to promote social reforms and housing improvements for middle-income families. This influenced the development of 20th century urban planning in the US. ## Oakland ### Cathedral of Learning The Cathedral of Learning is the centerpiece of the University of Pittsburgh's main campus in Oakland. Standing at 535 feet, the 42-story Cathedral is the tallest educational building in the western hemisphere and the second tallest in the world. The Cathedral was commissioned in 1921 and finished in 1937, and has 2,529 windows. ### Nationality Rooms The first and third floors of the Cathedral of Learning are home to 29 Nationality Rooms. As gifts to the University of Pittsburgh from the city's ethnic communities, these 30 unique classrooms take you on a voyage of world cultures and global traditions. Witness designs that range from Byzantine and Classical to Renaissance and Romanesque. Step inside Beijing, Damascus, Athens and more to hear each room's unique story without having set foot outside Pittsburgh. ## Authentic Experiences [iframe](https://c7d111ae6a728604daf22b8ce73917ec.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-45/html/container.html) [iframe](https://c7d111ae6a728604daf22b8ce73917ec.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-45/html/container.html) [iframe](https://c7d111ae6a728604daf22b8ce73917ec.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-45/html/container.html)",

The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page. ### Usage in popular culture - The January 11, 1975, episode of the _[Mary Tyler Moore Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\")_ featured [Super Bowl IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_IX \"Super Bowl IX\") (featuring the Steelers) as a plot device.[\\[225\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-p506-226) - _[Black Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sunday_(1977_film) \"Black Sunday (1977 film)\")_ in 1977[\\[226\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-r500-227) - _[Heaven Can Wait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Can_Wait_(1978_film) \"Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)\")_ in 1978[\\[227\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-h078-228) - _[Smokey and the Bandit II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_and_the_Bandit_II \"Smokey and the Bandit II\")_ in",

Reiner studied with Hungarian composer [Béla Bartók](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k \"Béla Bartók\") and programmed many of Bartók's works in Pittsburgh Symphony performances.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-Brignano_and_McCullough_2011,_55-21)[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-22) Women joined the orchestra for the first time during World War II. Eighteen women joined in 1942, and 24 more women joined in 1944. The PSO had more female performers than any other major American symphony during the war.[\\[21\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-Brignano_and_McCullough_2011,_55-21) [Victor De Sabata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_De_Sabata \"Victor De Sabata\") came to Pittsburgh in 1948, in part because of the urgings of his colleague [Vladimir Bakaleinikoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Bakaleinikoff \"Vladimir Bakaleinikoff\"), whom he had conducted in [Cincinnati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati \"Cincinnati\") in 1927. Ticket sales increased with de Sabata at the helm. He was so popular with local audiences that around 1,200 people attended a concert he conducted at the [Syria Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_Mosque \"Syria Mosque\") during one of Pittsburgh's worst snowstorms.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-23) He returned to conduct the orchestra in 1949, 1950, and 1951.[\\[24\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-24) The orchestra established a Guest Conductor Chair in his name in 2010. ### 1952–1976: The Steinberg years \\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: 1952–1976: The Steinberg years\")\\] [William Steinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Steinberg \"William Steinberg\") became the orchestra's music director in 1952. During the early part of the 1950s, the Symphony played a number of \"industry concerts\", conducted by Steinberg and sponsored by area industries, specifically the United Steelworkers of America. The sponsorship offset costs for industry workers, and the Symphony performed in more convenient locations throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.[\\[25\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-25)[\\[26\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-26) The Symphony continued to bring music to smaller communities in partnership with Manufacturers Heat and Light Company and Columbia Gas during the Steinberg era.[\\[27\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-27) The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performed for audiences in [Warsaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw \"Warsaw\"), [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid \"Madrid\"), [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin \"Berlin\"), [Zagreb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreb \"Zagreb\"), [Reykjavik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk \"Reykjavík\"), and 15 other locations throughout Europe and the Middle East during the State Department tour.[\\[28\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-28) Many of the orchestra's earlier recordings were made in the [Syria Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_Mosque \"Syria Mosque\") with labels such as [Capitol Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records \"Capitol Records\") and [Columbia Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records \"Columbia Records\").[\\[29\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-29) The Pittsburgh Symphony performed at the Syria Mosque from 1926 until 1971. The building was torn down in 1992. Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony made several recordings for the Command label starting in 1962. These recordings were made at the [Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldiers_and_Sailors_Memorial_Hall_and_Museum \"Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum\") in Pittsburgh. The technical superiority of the Command recordings was aided by the company's use of 35mm film as the recording medium.[\\[30\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-New_York_Times-30) Steinberg conducted his final Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concerts as music director in 1976, after which he returned for guest-conducting appearances as music director emeritus.[\\[31\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-31)[\\[32\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-32) ### 1976–1984: The Previn years \\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: 1976–1984: The Previn years\")\\] [André Previn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Previn \"André Previn\") succeeded Steinberg as music director in 1976.

Prior Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra Fellows have experienced substantial career advancement as a result of the fellowship: - **2019-2022** Fellow Shantanique Moore, flute, won a position as the African American Orchestra Fellow with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra for their 2022-23 season. Ms. Moore was named the eighth OTPAAM Fellow for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons and was the first Paul J. Ross Fellow during the 2021-2022 season. - **2017-2019** Fellow Joshua Jones, percussion, won a position with the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra as Principal Percussion during the first year of the fellowship. He previously served as Principal Percussion of the Kansas City Symphony and now serves as Principal Percussion of the Grant Park Orchestra. - **2015-2017** Fellow Torrell Moss, percussion, was accepted as an Artist Diploma candidate at Frost School of Music at the University of Miami, as a result of his fellowship. Moss has recently held positions with the Rainey Institute and Ashland Symphony Orchestra in Ohio, and performed in M.U.S.i.C.’s Stars in the Classics garden concert in 2020. - **2013-2015** Fellow Adedeji Ogunfolu, horn, won a position with the San Antonio Symphony during the first year of the fellowship. He joined the Pacific Symphony as second horn in 2018, and has been appointed as Professor of Horn at the University of California, Irvine. - **2011-2013** Fellow Ryan Murphy, cello, won a position with the San Antonio Symphony in 2012 and is currently in his ninth season with the orchestra. - **2007-2008** Fellow Geoffrey Johnson, oboe, was the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s first OTPAAM Fellow. He won acting second oboe of the Detroit Symphony from 2014-2017, and he is currently a private lessons teacher and guest oboist in major orchestras across the country. * * * The Paul J. Ross Fellowship is made possible, in part, thanks to generous funding from the Arts, Equity, & Education Fund; the PA Department of Education with support from State Senator Camera Bartolotta; Hans & Leslie Fleischner; Anonymous Friends of the Orchestra; and EQT Foundation. The Arts, Equity, & Education Fund and Leslie and the late Hans Fleischner also seek to inspire others who believe in the mission of the Paul J. Ross Fellowship Program by pledging funds of an additional $150,000 to be matched by new and increased gifts to the Pittsburgh Symphony specifically for this program through the 2025/2026 season. If successfully matched, the financial need for the program will be almost fully met for all four years. # Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra Menu",

In 1898, [Victor Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Herbert \"Victor Herbert\") was chosen to lead the orchestra.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-1) The orchestra traveled at a more frequent rate under Herbert's tenure, performing in [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston \"Boston\"), Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Canada.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-2) Its personnel included such musicians as [Luigi von Kunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_von_Kunits \"Luigi von Kunits\") (later the first conductor of the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Symphony_Orchestra \"Toronto Symphony Orchestra\")) as concertmaster, first violinist Frederick William Stahlberg,[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-3) second violinist [John Stepan Zamecnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stepan_Zamecnik \"John Stepan Zamecnik\"), assistant principal cello [Gaston Borch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Borch \"Gaston Borch\"), Paul Henneberg as first flute, and Leon Medaer as first clarinet.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-4) Herbert composed two orchestral works that the Pittsburgh Orchestra premiered: his _Suite romantique_ op. 31 (which he also dedicated to the orchestra)[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-5) and the [tone poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_poem \"Tone poem\") _Hero and Leander_ op. 33.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-6) Under Herbert's direction, the Pittsburgh Orchestra played as part of the [Pan-American Exposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-American_Exposition \"Pan-American Exposition\") at the 1901 World's Fair in [Buffalo, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York \"Buffalo, New York\"), for which Herbert had also composed an original work for the exhibition titled \"Panamericana: Morceau Characteristique\" for the Orchestra to perform.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-7) His tenure with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra ended in 1904 because of increasingly strident disagreements with the orchestra's manager, George H. Wilson, who disliked Herbert's populist manner and personally despised him.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-8) When Herbert left the orchestra in 1904, the Symphony Society chose as his successor Austrian conductor [Emil Paur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Paur \"Emil Paur\"). Paur took an intellectual approach to his work and avoided theatrics. Trained as a violinist, he had served as conductor of both the [Boston Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Symphony_Orchestra \"Boston Symphony Orchestra\") and the [New York Philharmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Philharmonic \"New York Philharmonic\"), as well as guest conductor throughout Europe,[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-9) and held the Pittsburgh Orchestra to the same exacting standards. Paur's programs emphasized the classical repertoire and increased the presence of works by [Johannes Brahms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Brahms \"Johannes Brahms\"), whose music was considered too challenging for most audiences at that time. Additionally, Paur clashed with many of the orchestra's musicians when he prohibited them from accepting outside performing engagements and continued to hire mainly European musicians.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-10) Orchestra manager George H. Wilson resigned on December 24, 1906, shortly after the beginning of Paur's third season, saying that his tenure, pride, and pleasure with the orchestra:",

More than half a million people hear the PSO in concert every year, and millions more enjoy the orchestra's splendid performances through radio broadcasts and recordings. In order to maintain the artistic excellence which distinguishes the Orchestra, a capital campaign was launched in 1993 to increase the PSO's endowment by $70 million. The receipt of an extraordinary lead gift of $20 million from the Howard Heinz and Vira I. Heinz Endowments - the largest single gift ever awarded a symphony orchestra capital campaign - gave the Orchestra confidence it needed to meet its goal and fulfill its mission for many years to come. On April 10, 1995, the Orchestra announced the appointment of Mariss Jansons to succeed Maazel in 1996. As eighth Music Director of the PSO, he ushered in the next century of extraordinary music making. His performances and recordings with the Oslo Philharmonic, the St. Petersburg (formerly the Leningrad) Philharmonic Orchestra, and the London Philharmonic led the London Times to call him \"one of the most exciting conductors in the world today.\" In 1995, the PSO also welcomed Marvin Hamlisch as the Orchestra's first Principal Pops Conductor. Composer of over forty motion picture scores and the Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway show _A Chorus Line_, Hamlisch previously appeared as guest conductor of symphony orchestras around the world. With three Oscars, four Grammys, a Tony and three Golden Globe awards to his credit, Hamlisch eagerly began exploring new avenues of music-making with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. In January 2004, the PSO with conductor Gilbert Levine became the first American orchestra to perform at the Vatican for Pope John Paul II to commemorate the Pontiff's Silver Jubilee celebration and his lifelong commitment to interfaith understanding and outreach of the Abrahamic faiths. The appearance at the Vatican was an expression of the highest regard for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra's artistic excellence and standing in the worldwide music community. **Music can make a difference.** It has the potential to bring all people together. - _Marvin Hamlisch_ ## 2005 - 2007 ### The Team for the Times The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra entered a bold new era with the 2005-06 season introducing its innovative model for artistic leadership. The team of Sir Andréw Davis, serving as Artistic Advisor; Yan Pascal Tortelier, Principal Guest Conductor; and Marek Janowski, Endowed Guest Conductor Chair, bring to the orchestra significant expertise in a richly diverse repertoire. Each focuses on different areas of repertoire, which highlights their strengths and interests. Sir Andréw Davis, while providing overall programming input regarding the entire season and leading the orchestra in a variety of styles, pays special attention to the music of British and American composers. Yan Pascal Tortelier focuses on French composers and hidden treasures of the 20th century along with music of the 21st century. Marek Janowski has had a relationship with the Orchestra since 1991, conducting the great masters of the German-Austrian repertoire that have been central to the identity of the orchestra since the days of former Music Director William Steinberg.

        "text": "a protégé of Otto Klemperer, Steinberg had a glamorous career in his homeland of Germany before fleeing the Nazis in 1936. Arturo Toscanini invited him to organize the newly formed Palestine Orchestra in Tel Aviv (today's Israel Philharmonic Orchestra) and, in 1937, to become his associate conductor at the NBC Orchestra. Steinberg went on to direct the Buffalo Philharmonic before becoming Music Director of the PSO in 1952. The Boston Symphony Orchestra engaged him as Music Director from 1969 to 1972, a post he held concurrently with his PSO Music Directorship. On August 14, 1964, the PSO embarked on an 11-week, 24,000 mile tour to 14 nations in Europe and the Near East. Sponsored by the U.S. State Department, the tour earned the Smoky city a reputation for producing more than steel and elevated the image of American culture abroad. **One must always respect the character** of the music and never try to grow lush foliage in a well tempered English garden. - _William Steinberg_ **Steinberg conducted this complex work** with amazing control, exacting the fullest possible interest from the score. - _Pittsburgh Press_, January 9, 1954 Some of the Orchestra's best recordings were made in the Syria Mosque where the PSO performed from 1926 until 1971. The building was torn down in 1992 to the dismay of many who had attended concerts there. The opening of Heinz Hall on September 10, 1971 marked the completion of an 11-year campaign, initiated by Henry J. Heinz II. The resplendent concert hall stands as a testimonial to the civic spirit that has supported Pittsburgh's cultural organizations since the turn of the century. At the time of Steinberg's death in 1978, his stepson remembered him with these words in _Music Journal:_\"He moved to Pittsburgh in 1952. His career reached its zenith there. He built the Orchestra into an instrument totally sensitive to his will, his touch. He loved them like his children, and criticized them as such. For twenty-five years he made beautiful music with that orchestra. Even when their sound was not as good as that of greater ensembles, they played for him beyond their capacities. He was desolate when he retired, he did not want to let go.\" ## 1976-1984 ### The Previn Years In addition to his considerable talents as a conductor, André Previn brought to the PSO his virtuosity at the piano and a musical sensibility shaped in Hollywood. He began studying piano in his native Berlin at the age of six before the rise of the Nazi regime sent his family first to Paris and later to Los Angeles. In his teenage years he began composing, arranging and conducting film scores. The four-time Academy Award Winner developed an equally successful career as a Jazz pianist before turning to conducting in 1960. In 1968 he was appointed Principal Conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. He held that post until 1979, having already assumed the Music Directorship of the PSO in 1976. Previn often brought jazz to the concert hall. In February 1977, the PSO and Previn made their national debut on",

Prior Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra Fellows have experienced substantial career advancement as a result of the fellowship: - **2019-2022** Fellow Shantanique Moore, flute, won a position as the African American Orchestra Fellow with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra for their 2022-23 season. Ms. Moore was named the eighth OTPAAM Fellow for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons and was the first Paul J. Ross Fellow during the 2021-2022 season. - **2017-2019** Fellow Joshua Jones, percussion, won a position with the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra as Principal Percussion during the first year of the fellowship. He previously served as Principal Percussion of the Kansas City Symphony and now serves as Principal Percussion of the Grant Park Orchestra. - **2015-2017** Fellow Torrell Moss, percussion, was accepted as an Artist Diploma candidate at Frost School of Music at the University of Miami, as a result of his fellowship. Moss has recently held positions with the Rainey Institute and Ashland Symphony Orchestra in Ohio, and performed in M.U.S.i.C.’s Stars in the Classics garden concert in 2020. - **2013-2015** Fellow Adedeji Ogunfolu, horn, won a position with the San Antonio Symphony during the first year of the fellowship. He joined the Pacific Symphony as second horn in 2018, and has been appointed as Professor of Horn at the University of California, Irvine. - **2011-2013** Fellow Ryan Murphy, cello, won a position with the San Antonio Symphony in 2012 and is currently in his ninth season with the orchestra. - **2007-2008** Fellow Geoffrey Johnson, oboe, was the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s first OTPAAM Fellow. He won acting second oboe of the Detroit Symphony from 2014-2017, and he is currently a private lessons teacher and guest oboist in major orchestras across the country. * * * The Paul J. Ross Fellowship is made possible, in part, thanks to generous funding from the Arts, Equity, & Education Fund; the PA Department of Education with support from State Senator Camera Bartolotta; Hans & Leslie Fleischner; Anonymous Friends of the Orchestra; and EQT Foundation. The Arts, Equity, & Education Fund and Leslie and the late Hans Fleischner also seek to inspire others who believe in the mission of the Paul J. Ross Fellowship Program by pledging funds of an additional $150,000 to be matched by new and increased gifts to the Pittsburgh Symphony specifically for this program through the 2025/2026 season. If successfully matched, the financial need for the program will be almost fully met for all four years. # Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra Menu",

Pittsburgh sits at a unique confluence of rivers unlike any other in the world, diverse and more abundant than any other state except Alaska. The three rivers that meet in Pittsburgh are actually a vast watershed of more than a dozen unique creeks and river systems that include more than 30,000 miles of rivers and streams extending into New York and West Virginia. These clean and accessible waters have become a stunning icon of Pittsburgh's environmental transformation. ## Kayaking, Paddling & Rowing Pittsburgh's rivers are ideal for sculling, kayaking and canoeing. The [Three Rivers Water Trail System](http://www.friendsoftheriverfront.org/ \"Three Rivers Water Trail System\") is a project intended to develop the rivers as recreational waterways with convenient access points and day-use sites; the Allegheny River Trail is already complete. On the Allegheny River in the heart of [Downtown Pittsburgh](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/downtown-pittsburgh/), [Kayak Pittsburgh](https://ventureoutdoors.org/kayak-pittsburgh/ \"Kayak Pittsburgh\") rents solo and tandem kayaks, canoes, and hydrobikes for peaceful urban exploration. Located under the 31st Street Bridge on the [North Shore](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/north-shore-north-side/), the [Three Rivers Rowing Association](http://www.threeriversrowing.org/ \"Three Rivers Rowing Association\") offers rowing, kayaking, and dragon boating to individuals, schools and organizations of all skill levels. The [Steel City Rowing Club](http://www.steelcityrowing.org/ \"Steel City Rowing Club\") is the only rowing organization on the upper Allegheny River, which boasts nine full miles of rowing without locks or dams, on relatively undeveloped wetlands. ## Boating Pittsburgh has the second-largest number of registered pleasure boats in the country. There are [seventeen marinas](http://www.fish.state.pa.us/marinas.htm \"Seventeen Marinas\") in Allegheny County along the three rivers, offering river access, dining and boat maintenance. [Station Square](http://www.stationsquare.com/ \"Station Square\") in the [South Side](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/neighborhoods/south-side/) offers public docks at Bessemer Court, for easy river access to downtown shopping and dining. Also within the city limits are four [public boat launches](http://www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Portals/72/docs/Recreation/BOAT%20LAUNCHING%20RAMPS.pdf \"Public Boat Launches\"), one on the Monongahela River in the South Side and three along the Allegheny River Trail. Visitors can rent kayaks and boats at the North Park Boathouse through [Venture Outdoors](http://www.ventureoutdoors.org/). ## Fishing There are 38.3 miles of river shoreline within the city limits. [Venture Outdoors](http://www.ventureoutdoors.org/ \"Venture Outdoors\") organizes weekly lunchtime fishing in [Point State Park](http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/point/ \"link to Point State Park website\") or [North Shore Riverfront Park](http://www.pgh-sea.com/northshoreriverfrontpark.htm \"North Shore Riverfront Park\"), with an instructor on hand to help the novice and expert alike.

The company was founded by five women who established the Pittsburgh Opera Society in 1939, making possible the inaugural performance of [Offenbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Offenbach \"Jacques Offenbach\")'s _[Les Contes d'Hoffmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Contes_d%27Hoffmann \"Les Contes d'Hoffmann\")_ at the [Carnegie Music Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Music_Hall \"Carnegie Music Hall\") in March 1940.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-3) The first director of the company was Richard Karp, from 1942 to 1977. His daughter Barbara Karp took over her father's duties during his final illness. James DeBlasis then served as interim artistic director after the resignation of Barbara Karp. In 1983, [Tito Capobianco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Capobianco \"Tito Capobianco\") became Pittsburgh Opera's general director, holding this position until 1997.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-Croan1-4) From 1997 to 2000, Capobianco was the company's artistic director, before leaving in 2000.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-5) Mark Weinstein became general director of Pittsburgh Opera in 1999, after starting as executive director in 1997.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-Croan1-4) During his tenure, he presided over an increase in the company's endowment from US $4 million to US $16 million, as well as the retirement of US $2.5 million in debt.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-6) Weinstein also presided over the addition of an extra production during the company season, 5 productions as opposed to 4, from the 2001-2002 season to the 2003-2004 season.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-7) Weinstein announced his resignation as Pittsburgh Opera's general director effective February 1, 2008.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-8) Artistic Director Christopher Hahn was appointed as [General Director](http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1452015/pittsburgh_opera_appoints_christopher_hahn_its_general_director/index.html) in June 2008.

While Mimì and Rodolfo recall their happiness, Musetta quarrels with Marcello (Dunque è proprio finite). Mimì and Rodolfo decide to stay together until spring. **ACT IV.** Some months later, Rodolfo and Marcello lament their loneliness in the garret (O Mimì, tu più non torni). Colline and Schaunard bring a meager meal. The four stage a dance, which turns into a mock fight. The merrymaking is ended when Musetta bursts in, saying Mimì is downstairs, too weak to climb up. As Rodolfo runs to her, Musetta tells how Mimì has begged to be taken to her lover to die. While Mimì is made comfortable, Marcello goes with Musetta to sell her earrings for medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his cherished overcoat (Vecchia zimarra \"Old coat\"). Alone, Mimì and Rodolfo recall their first days together (Sono andati? \"Have they gone?\"), but she is seized with coughing. When the others return, Musetta gives Mimì a muff to warm her hands and prays for her life. Mimì dies quietly (Dorme? . . .

Visual Arts. Festivals. Arts Education. Urban Development.\n\nSince 1984, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, a non-profit arts organization, has worked to make the Steel City a place where the arts can flourish. Our efforts have focused on the cultural and economic development of the Cultural District, a 14-square-block area of downtown Pittsburgh. What was once a downtrodden red light district now thrives as a vibrant center for culture, art, food, and community. Pittsburgh’s Cultural District stands as a nationwide model for how the arts can play a pivotal role in urban revitalization.\n\nEach year, millions of people visit the Cultural District to expand their horizons in our theaters, galleries, and public art environments. Patrons enjoy thousands of [world-class performing arts events](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/events/series) and [visual arts exhibitions](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/visual-arts). Pittsburgh residents of all ages connect and learn with the Trust’s [comprehensive education](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/education) and community engagement opportunities. Local arts organizations collaborate to build a stronger cultural community through the [power of partnerships](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/about/organization/shared-services).\n\nThe Cultural District acts as the anchor for all of that work. The Trust’s [superior venues](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/visit/facilities) and [gallery spaces](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/visual-arts/galleries) allow resident companies, community organizations, artists, and promoters to reach audiences large and small.

The Little Penguins Learn to Play program is offered at over twenty local ice rinks throughout the Western Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio and West Virginia region. Although, not every ice rink hosts during each session (Fall, Winter and Spring). A list of locations hosting during the current/upcoming session, can be found after clicking the “Register Now!” button above, under the \"Open Registrations\" section.

Can I cancel the registration? We understand that things change and ask that you contact us as soon as possible with any refund requests. Please understand the Little Penguins Learn to Play program cannot offer refunds for participants that: do not meet the program eligibility requirements; register for multiple locations/sessions; or cancel after the registrant’s equipment is kitted and/or picked up. This policy is in place because once registration fees are collected, preparations for an individuals participation begin quickly by the Penguins as well as host sites to kit equipment, plan ice time/coaches and other fixed costs. All of which are expenses that cannot be recouped if a registrant cancels in the above instances. We care about your customer experience and will work to accommodate each request individually. Please email [littlepenguins@pittsburghpenguins.com](mailto:littlepenguins@pittsburghpenguins.com) with any cancellation questions. removeaddI want to register my child at our local rink, but the Little Penguins sessions are full.

We will do our best to contact participants on the waitlist to move them onto a roster should a spot become available. removeaddI have two children. Will they be in the same session?

        "text": "Erick Ilkhanipour. The grand finale ends with a big bang, thanks to the humble pinecone. The cones hold their seeds for decades, Hennessy explains, but when there’s a forest fire the heat melts the wax inside the cones, eventually causing them to break open. The seeds that are released help rejuvenate the forest. “It’s like Jiffy Pop,” says Hennessy of the time-release mechanism. Scientists use the same principle on heat-activated fire sprinklers. To drive the lesson home, Hennessy places foam pinecones on top of a plastic trash can filled with hot water. He then adds liquid nitrogen to mimic the effect of wax inside the cone. Slowly the pressure builds until the top pops off the trash can with a loud bang, knocking the pinecones to the ground. “I liked the explosion,” says 8-year-old Nyla McGinnis. “It was a really loud boom. I learned that animals help make technology.” She also likes Hennessy. “He’s funny,” she says, grinning widely. Zachary Fairfull, a 10-year-old science buff, loved all the live demos. “It was interesting to know that people see animal properties and then put them into projects or robots.” Amy O’Neill, development coordinator for the zoo, says Wild by Design helps make a strong argument for wildlife conservation. “It shows kids that there’s another reason to pay attention and take care of all the species on the planet, beyond them just being beautiful or cute,” she says. “Having biodiversity also provides something for us.” Also in this issue: 2013 Carnegie International · Artist as Activist · History Redux · Artists In Their Own Words · Frozen In Time · The Stand-In · Director’s Note · NewsWorthy · Face Time: Lauren Talotta · Science & Nature: Cultural Craftsman · The Big Picture Copyright © 2017 CARNEGIE Magazine.

        "text": "Manual Cinema’s _The 4th Witch_ is a fantastic new tale, inspired by elements of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, in which a girl escapes war and flees into a dark forest. Told through shadow puppetry, actors in silhouette and live music (without dialogue or narration), _The 4th Witch_ begins on the eve of an invasion of a small town by the local warlord, Macbeth. The girl flees the invading army and escapes into the nearby forest. Orphaned and exiled, she is rescued by a witch, who adopts her as an apprentice. As she becomes more skilled in witchcraft, her grief and rage draw her into a nightmarish quest for vengeance against the warlord who killed her parents: Macbeth. _The 4th Witch_, an inversion of Shakespeare’s Macbeth, explores themes of grief, war, generational conflict, and cycles of violence through the collateral damage left behind on the battleground. **Please note: This production contains loud sounds and flashing lights.** **This engagement of Manual Cinema is made possible in part through the ArtsCONNECT program of Mid Atlantic Arts with support from the National Endowment for the Arts.**( [www.midatlanticarts.org](http://www.midatlanticarts.org/ \"http://www.midatlanticarts.org\")) [**10+ Tickets On Sale NOW!**](https://trustarts.org/pct_home/group-sales/the-4th-witch)![Photo of Theater Square](https://assets.culturaldistrict.org/culturaldistrict/system/assets/21501/original/ta_pages_theater_square_thumbnail.png) #### Pittsburgh Cultural Trust 803 Liberty Avenue Pittsburgh,PA15222 Admin: [412-471-6070](tel:4124716070) Box Office: [412-456-6666](tel:4124566666) Time left to complete order ## The 4th Witch ## The 4th Witch Sat, Oct 25, 2025, 7:00pm [Get Tickets](https://trustarts.org/production/102017/performance/102017/seat_selection) - Trust Family Series - Byham Theater - [Family](https://trustarts.org/calendar?genre=Family) #### Video The 4th Witch \\| Promo Video - YouTube [Photo image of Pittsburgh Cultural Trust](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEQO2qJq2cbQcKgUHUCdKkg?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Ftrustarts.org%2F) Pittsburgh Cultural Trust 1.27K subscribers [The 4th Witch \\| Promo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvJgCIGhq2k) Pittsburgh Cultural Trust Watch later Share Copy link Info Shopping Tap to unmute If playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.

Steelers fans saw on Sunday what DK Metcalf brings to the offense when he broke loose for an 80-yard touchdown reception against the Minnesota Vikings, speeding down the sidelines for the score. Receivers coach Zach Azzanni jokingly said he would like to take credit for Metcalf's yards after catch because they put so much focus on it every practice, but he said it was all Metcalf. \"We work on it a lot. We emphasize it a lot, every drill that we do, every route,\" said Azzanni. \"I show film of it throughout the week, of other teams, of us. We talk about all of that. \"I would love to tell you that DK was all coaching, but that one, it was him. I got a lot teasing about that. But we do coach it, we emphasize it just like everyone else in the league does it, but those guys make it breathe.\" And what Metcalf has brought to the offense, in the words of Azzanni is a breath of fresh air. Metcalf, who was acquired in a trade with the Seattle Seahawks this offseason, has a business-like approach to the game, wanting nothing more than to win every week. \"It's been a pleasure,\" said Azzanni of working with Metcalf. \"It's a breath of fresh air. He's great to work with. He's a true pro. He does anything you ask him to do. He's a team guy, which is really cool. \"He gets as excited when other guys make plays as he does when he makes a play. And when you have a room like that with a lot of guys and your bell cow is wired like that, it's a pleasure to coach. \"It's fun to go in the meeting room. No one's too prideful to take corrections. So, it's been a really good addition having him there.\" It's an attitude Azzanni said permeates not just with Metcalf, but throughout the entire receiver room, including Calvin Austin III, Roman Wilson, Scotty Miller and Ben Skowronek. And their performance reflects that. \"These guys are just doing what they're asked to do, which is cool,\" said Azzanni. \"The goal is to win football games. If they block 40 times, they block 40 times We throw 40 times, we throw 40 and none of them say a word. \"They're a very unselfish group. It's a really good room. So, I feel good about where they are.\" Another player who epitomizes that unselfish approach is Skowronek. He might not get the numbers in the receiving game, but he contributes in ways that are hard to measure. \"Ben's the kind of guy that you don't want on other teams,\" said Azzanni. \"You like it on your team. He's a guy that does all the dirty work. He is the goon, if you will. And he is a sneaky good receiver too.",

This might be more of a \"think about it\" than a question, but imagine one of the Steelers regular home games every year being played in Ireland?** ANSWER: Since we're \"thinking about it,\" I don't think the Steelers ever would have an annual International Game, because a team like Jacksonville has an annual International; Game because the Jaguars were having trouble selling tickets to their home games. I can't see the Steelers wanting to take a home game out of Pittsburgh every year, and I don't believe the NFL would be in favor of that either. Just what I 'think.\" **ROBERT KLACZAK FROM PALMYRA, PA: Kickoffs are consistently landing around the 1-yard line. Why do the kickoff returners not line up a few yards into the end zone and get a running start when they catch the ball? They would get up to full speed more quickly and likely get a longer return.** ANSWER: Theoretically that is correct, but what if the kickoff isn't kicked directly to a returner, and so getting a running start also might involve running on an angle. Those would be harder to catch and secure, and harder to block for because everything could change as the ball is kicked. If it's blocked correctly, and the returner hits the crease that's created, you have a chance at a big return with less risk. **JOHN SUSKO FROM NAPLES, FL: Will the Steelers activate Will Howard and place Skylar Thompson on injured reserve?** ANSWER: Skylar Thompson already is on injured reserve. The Steelers have 2 QBs on their 53-man roster – Aaron Rodgers and Mason Rudolph. Logan Woodside is on the practice squad. **SCOTT BEACHAM FROM CHICAGO, IL: I'm wondering what the Steelers can do now that Will Howard is available to come off IR? We can't sign him to the practice squad, and I cannot imagine adding him to the 53-man roster. Can the Steelers just keep him on IR for remainder of the season since he won't play anyway?** ANSWER: I cannot tell you what the Steelers are going to do with Will Howard, except to say I am confident they are not going to expose him to waivers. **GRANT MOORE FROM ZANESVILLE, OH: I am a huge fan of \"what if\" stories. So, I got a \"what if\" question for you. What if the Steelers beat the Packers in Super Bowl XLV?** ANSWER: If the Steelers had defeated the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV, they would have seven Lombardi Trophies instead of six. **RICHARD SHARRATT FROM REDCAR, ENGLAND:",

        "text": "the puck too long, things like that. It’s really just playing more of a pro game, keeping it more simple, and taking opportunities when I can.” Brunicke’s offensive awareness and puck skills came into full effect on Friday’s game against Buffalo. The smooth-skating defenseman scored an impressive goal that had little-to-no angle to get the puck under the bar and past Sabres goaltender Alex Lyon. “I just got some time on the blue line,” said Brunicke on his goal. “I made a play down low and luckily enough I saw some space, and it went in.” At just 19 years old, Brunicke has shown the ability to form his game at an NHL-caliber level with each passing day. “From the start, each day I just came in here with an open mindset of just wanting to get better,” Brunicke said. “You look around the room at all these great players, and it’s so cool to learn from them and see the work they put in and just kind of feed off that.” \\*When attending training camp last season, Sergei Murashov did not see any preseason action. The 2022 fourth-round pick made the most of his appearances this season, posting a .932 save percentage in the three appearances he made. While Murashov’s play has been impressive, what stands out to Muse is the work ethic, as the 21-year-old goalie has been the last one off the ice after practices. \"He’s obviously had a very strong camp, and he’s young,” Muse said. “It’s good to see a young player like that who’s pushing as hard as he is, who’s as competitive as he is, and dedicated as he is.\" After coming to North America last season, Murashov dominated at both the AHL and ECHL levels, saying all of that experience helped him a lot. “I would say the main thing is the work, it paid off,” said Murashov on his biggest takeaway from training camp. “It’s a very enjoyable time. Even if it’s a hard process. Guys are working hard. They challenge you every day. You have to respond. That’s really nice to be (a part of) always.” President of Hockey Operations and GM Kyle Dubas said at the start of training camp that ultimately, the two best goaltenders will make the team come opening night, regardless of contract status. While time will tell how things unfold going into the first game, Murashov is proud of the work he has put in and will continue to put his best foot forward. “I just did my job. I just stop the puck. The decision is up to them. Whatever they will say and (determine), I will take it and just keep going,” Murashov said. ### Youth Movement Shapes Penguins’ Roster Decisions Oct 04, 2025 ### Healthy Novak Looking to Carve Out Role with Penguins Oct 03, 2025 ### Penguins Preseason Lineup Versus Sabres (10.03.25) Oct 02, 2025 ### Penguins Trim Training Camp Roster Oct 02, 2025 ### Musings: Penguins 5, Sabres 3 (Preseason Game 6) Oct 01, 2025 ### Penguins Preseason Lineup Versus Sabres (10.01.25)",

The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page. ### Usage in popular culture - The January 11, 1975, episode of the _[Mary Tyler Moore Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\")_ featured [Super Bowl IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_IX \"Super Bowl IX\") (featuring the Steelers) as a plot device.[\\[225\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-p506-226) - _[Black Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sunday_(1977_film) \"Black Sunday (1977 film)\")_ in 1977[\\[226\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-r500-227) - _[Heaven Can Wait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Can_Wait_(1978_film) \"Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)\")_ in 1978[\\[227\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers#cite_note-h078-228) - _[Smokey and the Bandit II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_and_the_Bandit_II \"Smokey and the Bandit II\")_ in",

        "text": "to a game like this here in Ireland.\" Bruener was asked if the Steelers reach out to alumni in situations such as the historic Ireland trip. \"I think it was more (the former players) saying, 'Please, can I come? And is there anything I can do?' That's the way we are, the way the Steeler family is.\" Added Pouncey: \"I'm beyond grateful. The people here, the hospitality, this has been beyond a blessing for us.\" ——— For this writer, and some others, the journey across the pond started in, of all places, Cleveland. Direct flights on Aer Lingus bound for Dublin were available at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and many western Pennsylvanians took full advantage. No wonder an exasperated bartender at one of the Hopkins' establishments wondered aloud, \"Why is everyone in here wearing a Steelers jersey?\" There were fans from all over the world at the game, especially the host nation. But there was an atypical number of Steelers fans in attendance for such an NFL event, fans whose next game is as likely to be at Acrisure Stadium as anywhere else. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell detailed the departure from the norm in an interview with sideline reporter Missi Matthews on the Steelers Audio Network Pregame Show. For international games, \"We normally have most of our fans coming from the country that we're playing in, and that's why we're playing it,\" Goodell maintained. \"This game is different. I think one-third of the crowd here today came from the (United) States, and I think it'll be pretty Steeler-heavy. \"I'm not surprised, they travel better than any team in the NFL, probably.\" He wasn't wrong, either. In what was officially a home game for the Steelers, the Steelers' crowd took over at Croke Park. The Vikings were the team that had to resort with regularity to the silent count (although the Steelers had to on occasion, as well, such was the level of exuberance). And the Steelers played, not a complete game but one that was much more in tune with what they've been after all along than what they'd been able to muster in the season's first three weeks. They may have let a 24-6, fourth-quarter lead dwindle to three, the game may have come down to one final defensive stop and ended up being \"a little more entertaining than maybe it should have been,\" as head coach Mike Tomlin acknowledged. But in the end it was a beautiful day. They found much if not all of what they're looking for. Re-Joyce. Sometimes, the longest way 'round really is the shortest way home. ## Related Content [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/r5wihqhpcp1ymzo4baj2.jpg)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **A week to remember on the Emerald Isle**\\\\ \\\\ The Steelers visit to the island of Ireland in Week 4 was certainly one to remember](https://www.steelers.com/news/a-week-to-remember-on-the-emerald-isle \"A week to remember on the Emerald Isle\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/ftabibfkugcgdjveuqn0.png)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Ireland Blog: Home sweet home...kind of**\\\\ \\\\ Follow along for all of the news, notes and activities as a part of the Steelers visit to Dublin, Ireland to take on the Minnesota Vikings",

He helps me stretch my imagination.” – Madelyn Roehrig A local artist-educator discovers that she’s not alone in her quest to channel her inner Andy Warhol. By Julie Hannon Madelyn Roehrig visits Andy Warhol’s gravesite every day—for a year and counting. Ever wonder what outrageous ideas Andy Warhol would dream up in this digital age of push-button publishing, instant status updates, and 24-hour news? Now you can ask him. Asking Andy anything is the idea behind Madelyn Roehrig’s ongoing art project, Figments: Conversations with Andy, in which the artist-educator is documenting who visits the late artist’s grave and, more interestingly, why. Last February, Roehrig left a notebook at Warhol’s hillside gravesite in Bethel Park, about 10 miles south of Pittsburgh, encouraging visitors to ask Andy a question or leave a comment. Since then, she’s collected 230 handwritten messages—along with a white wig, a plastic penis, a rosary, paint brushes, crystals, Gas-X pills, a Celebrity tomato plant, numerous Coca-Cola bottles, and a plethora of Campbell’s soup cans—all left for the king of Pop Art. A photographer inquired, “Dear Andy, How do you put models at ease?” A designer traveling all the way from Mexico confessed, “I’m your #1 fan and you are my inspiration.” Another visitor confided, “Sorry you can’t be friends on Facebook and Twitter. You would have loved that.” “My husband Matthew and I drove all the way from Miami, Florida, just to be here with you,” wrote Julie R. “You were an amazing artist and a truly weird person.

So far, Andy has received 22 calls. “I was just going to take a picture here every day,” she explains, motioning toward Andy’s tombstone, tucked away in the non-descript St. John Byzantine Catholic Cemetery at the corner of Route 88 and Connor Road, where Warhol was buried with his parents. “But as I did, I started noticing things showing up, gifts for Andy, and I realized other people came, too. And I wondered why. I wanted to know what they were thinking and what they were asking—what they wanted from Andy. I also wanted to capture it all without being invasive, but I didn’t know what to do. So I asked Andy.” Roehrig does a lot of that—asking Andy. Living only three miles from the gravesite, she’s been visiting Warhol infrequently since 2006, and now, for this project, every day for more than a year. She says she talks to him “Whenever I have a situation.” These “situations” are almost always of the creative kind, and Andy almost always delivers. “I believe Andy is listening,” says Roehrig, “that’s why it works. He helps me stretch my imagination.” It all started when Roehrig, an education specialist at Carnegie Museum of Art, was stalled on an art installation she was developing for an exhibition at Seton Hill Uni­versity. Upon the anniversary of September 11, she started exploring terroristic images that enter people’s homes by way of their television sets. This conjured up Warhol’s famous Death and Disaster paintings, and off she went to sit and talk with Andy. Roehrig acknowledges that while this might seem odd to some, this kind of stream-of-consciousness thinking and quiet time at a cemetery isn’t so unusual for her, as she regularly visits and talks to her deceased parents and grandparents. Not long after talking it through with Andy, she decided that the best way to display the violent images she had captured from her television was to make time-based videos using the black-and-white images as a montage.

He helps me stretch my imagination.” – Madelyn Roehrig A local artist-educator discovers that she’s not alone in her quest to channel her inner Andy Warhol. By Julie Hannon Madelyn Roehrig visits Andy Warhol’s gravesite every day—for a year and counting. Ever wonder what outrageous ideas Andy Warhol would dream up in this digital age of push-button publishing, instant status updates, and 24-hour news? Now you can ask him. Asking Andy anything is the idea behind Madelyn Roehrig’s ongoing art project, Figments: Conversations with Andy, in which the artist-educator is documenting who visits the late artist’s grave and, more interestingly, why. Last February, Roehrig left a notebook at Warhol’s hillside gravesite in Bethel Park, about 10 miles south of Pittsburgh, encouraging visitors to ask Andy a question or leave a comment. Since then, she’s collected 230 handwritten messages—along with a white wig, a plastic penis, a rosary, paint brushes, crystals, Gas-X pills, a Celebrity tomato plant, numerous Coca-Cola bottles, and a plethora of Campbell’s soup cans—all left for the king of Pop Art. A photographer inquired, “Dear Andy, How do you put models at ease?” A designer traveling all the way from Mexico confessed, “I’m your #1 fan and you are my inspiration.” Another visitor confided, “Sorry you can’t be friends on Facebook and Twitter. You would have loved that.” “My husband Matthew and I drove all the way from Miami, Florida, just to be here with you,” wrote Julie R. “You were an amazing artist and a truly weird person. Hope all is well down there, the world up here misses you.” Most only leave their first names. Some live within walking distance but others have come from as far away as the Czech Republic. And they’re an eclectic bunch, including one of Warhol’s classmates (a 90-year-old Bethel Park man who now lives within eyeshot of Andy), belly dancers, budding artists, adoring fans and haters alike, tourists, grade-schoolers, and entire families on a pilgrimage to visit someone they talk to like an old friend. “Hi Andy, I brought my two small daughters with me today to see where you were buried because we’ve been discussing your art and they think it’s cool.

Thanks for the inspiration.” And if writing Andy a message by hand is too 20th century for some gravesite guests, Roehrig also mans Figments: Conversations with Andy on Facebook and the Andy Warhol Hotline at412.508.9245. So far, Andy has received 22 calls. “I was just going to take a picture here every day,” she explains, motioning toward Andy’s tombstone, tucked away in the non-descript St. John Byzantine Catholic Cemetery at the corner of Route 88 and Connor Road, where Warhol was buried with his parents. “But as I did, I started noticing things showing up, gifts for Andy, and I realized other people came, too. And I wondered why. I wanted to know what they were thinking and what they were asking—what they wanted from Andy. I also wanted to capture it all without being invasive, but I didn’t know what to do. So I asked Andy.” Roehrig does a lot of that—asking Andy. Living only three miles from the gravesite, she’s been visiting Warhol infrequently since 2006, and now, for this project, every day for more than a year. She says she talks to him “Whenever I have a situation.” These “situations” are almost always of the creative kind, and Andy almost always delivers. “I believe Andy is listening,” says Roehrig, “that’s why it works. He helps me stretch my imagination.” It all started when Roehrig, an education specialist at Carnegie Museum of Art, was stalled on an art installation she was developing for an exhibition at Seton Hill Uni­versity. Upon the anniversary of September 11, she started exploring terroristic images that enter people’s homes by way of their television sets. This conjured up Warhol’s famous Death and Disaster paintings, and off she went to sit and talk with Andy. Roehrig acknowledges that while this might seem odd to some, this kind of stream-of-consciousness thinking and quiet time at a cemetery isn’t so unusual for her, as she regularly visits and talks to her deceased parents and grandparents. Not long after talking it through with Andy, she decided that the best way to display the violent images she had captured from her television was to make time-based videos using the black-and-white images as a montage. It’s a ritual that’s become a part of her artistic process, and her life. A private part of her life until her classmates at Vermont College of Fine Arts, where she completed her master’s degree last year, pointed out the fact that her connection to Andy is her artwork. So the documenting began: recording the handwritten notes and eventually videotaping willing visitors. (Beginning April 11, Roehrig will videotape gravesite visitors from noon-2 p.m. on the second Sunday of every month). And",

Devoted to the history and heritage of Western Pennsylvania, our family of museums includes the Heinz History Center, Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Fort Pitt Museum, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. The History Center is home to the Thomas & Katherine Detre Library & Archives. Our mission is to engage and inspire large and diverse audiences through programs that enable links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection. This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs. ## Our Story The Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania. In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years. Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center’s collections. The Historical Society brought our region’s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region’s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region’s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region’s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today. Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members’ homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh’s Strip District. With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions. Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania’s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh’s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do",

Novak was on crutches for the first part of the offseason before returning to skating, training, and taking care of his new dog. “Me and my girlfriend got a new puppy,” Novak said with a smile. “His name is Manny. He’s a Golden Retriever puppy, he’s four and a half months now. Taking care of him, got him in July. So yeah, that was the big thing this summer, for sure.” Going into the final game of the preseason, Novak had picked up a goal and an assist in three appearances. While he feels okay, there is still work to do. “I think I'm just getting my legs under me every game a little bit more,” Novak said. “I think it can be hard, just haven’t played hockey in quite a while with the injury last year. So, I think it's getting better every game. I'm trying to just put a full 60 together. And yeah, I think there's been progress. So, I think it's on the uptrend.” His mindset for this season overall is continuing to work on his overall game, carve out a role and keep pushing forward. “I have had stretches in this league where I’ve been really good and maybe had some stretches where it’s not gone my way,” Novak said. “But I’ll just try to stay consistent every day and try to carve out a role where they can rely on me and I can be here for a while.” ### Youth Movement Shapes Penguins’ Roster Decisions Oct 04, 2025 ### Musings: Penguins 5, Sabres 4 OT (Preseason Finale) Oct 03, 2025 ### Penguins Preseason Lineup Versus Sabres (10.03.25) Oct 02, 2025 ### Penguins Trim Training Camp Roster Oct 02, 2025 ### Musings: Penguins 5, Sabres 3 (Preseason Game 6) Oct 01, 2025 ### Penguins Preseason Lineup Versus Sabres (10.01.25) Sep 30, 2025 ### Assistant Coach Spotlight: Rich Clune Sep 30, 2025 ### Building Brick by Brick: Kindel Earning Opportunities Sep 29, 2025 ### Penguins, F.N.B.

        "text": "- MOBILE TICKET BARCODE #### What is a Mobile Ticket Barcode? Each ticket has a mobile ticket barcode that must be scanned for entry into PNC Park via your mobile device. Within the Wallet, you can tap on an individual ticket to view its barcode. For entry to PNC Park, present your mobile device with the mobile barcode open and available to scan. #### How do I access the ticket to scan for entry? Tap on an individual ticket from the Tickets tab’s Wallet to pull up the mobile ticket barcode. The Section/Row/Seat and barcode will be displayed along with access to the terms and conditions governing your ticket. #### Why is my ticket barcode not showing in the MLB Ballpark app? There are several reasons why your barcode may not be available including that the ticket has been forwarded, the ticket had been forwarded to you and has since been canceled or recalled, or you are a group or suite buyer and the ticket status has changed. For mailed tickets, the ticket barcode will not appear until those tickets have been printed and mailed to you. For further assistance, contact Pirates Fans Services at [ticketservices@pirates.com](mailto:ticketservices@pirates.com) or 1-800-BUY-BUCS. #### I just forwarded a ticket via the MLB Ballpark app. Why do I still see it? Your ticket, without the barcode, will remain in your Tickets tab’s Wallet until your forward is accepted by the recipient. If you wish to cancel the forward, you can do that directly from the ticket. #### During what window of time can I forward tickets to friends? You can forward tickets via the MLB Ballpark app from the moment you purchase them until two hours after the first pitch of that day's game as long as that ticket has not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park. #### What should I do if I need to enter PNC Park for the start of the game and the rest of my group is not here yet? You can easily forward tickets to friends via the MLB Ballpark app up to two hours after the start of that day's game as long as the tickets have not already been scanned in for entry at PNC Park. #### Can I use Apple Wallet for my Pirates tickets? Yes. From the bottom of the ticket inside the MLB Ballpark app you can tap the \"Add to Wallet\" button to add your ticket to Apple Wallet. #### Can I use Google Pay for my Pirates tickets? No. Support for adding tickets to Google Pay is not yet available from the MLB Ballpark app. #### Why won't my ticket barcode scan? If your screen brightness is too low, the barcode may have difficulty being scanned. The MLB Ballpark app will automatically attempt to increase the brightness of your display or you can do so manually by following the instructions for your device. Please note, cracked screens may impact your barcode's ability to scan. The barcode displayed is accompanied by a number. If there are difficulties reading a valid barcode on a",

The opera deals not only with Thompson’s suffering in the jungle of southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, but also the tragic aftermath that followed his liberation. Colonel Thompson endured his brutal captivity by doggedly clinging to memories of his loving wife Alyce and their children. Alyce, however, believed Jim was dead. She and her children moved to Massachusetts with another man, leading to a painful reunion after Jim’s release. **Glory Denied** is, above all, the story of an American family during one our nation’s most turbulent eras. In its review of Mr. Philpott’s book, The New York Times stated: _Indeed it is not too much to say that **Glory Denied** and Colonel Thompson’s mixed feelings about it encapsulate something of the moral essence of the Vietnam War and the imperishable bitterness of its legacy._ **Glory Denied** will star Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artists, and be performed in the intimate environs of Pittsburgh Opera Headquarters. Limited capacity - order now! \" _Glory Denied as a whole is in keeping with Pittsburgh Opera’s past record of presenting contemporary works by gifted and impressive Resident Artists. The company deserves praise for consistently offering opportunities to hear rarities delivered by strong, young talent, and patronage is the only reward commensurate with its efforts...the work deserves full houses for all._\" - [Pittsburgh in the Round](https://www.pghintheround.com/pittsburgh-operas-premiere-of-glory-denied/) Older Thompson (Benjamin Taylor), Older Alyce (Caitlin Gotimer), Younger Alyce (Ashley Fabian) and Younger Thompson (Terrence Chin-Loy).

When they deactivated running back Jaylen Warren in advance of last Sunday's meeting with the Vikings in Dublin, the Steelers knew they'd have to replace their leading rusher and leading receiver through the season's first three weeks. They also knew what they had in running back Kenneth Gainwell. With Warren and his 132 rushing yards and 142 receiving yards sidelined due to a knee injury, Gainwell responded with a career day in the Steelers' 24-21 victory. Gainwell's 19 carries constituted a career-high total, as did his 99 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. His 5.2-yard average per carry was the second-highest he'd achieved in a game in which he'd been asked to carry the ball at least 10 times. Gainwell also had six catches on six targets for 35 receiving yards. His signature series in the estimation of running backs coach Eddie Faulkner was the five-play, 35-yard drive that produced a touchdown and a 21-6 Steelers' lead with 2:23 left in the third quarter. The possession commenced after an interception and 13-yard return by outside linebacker T.J. Watt. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers hit tight end Darnell Washington for 8 yards to start the march. After that, Gainwell carried for gains of 7, 6, 10 and 4 yards on the way to the end zone. \"You know, that drive, we went down and scored after T.J.'s interception, (Gainwell) was doing a really good job of controlling the game,\" Faulkner said. \"You saw some patience come out on him. Whether it was gap-scheme or zone-scheme he was being patient, letting the blocks develop for him and then bursting through the hole. \"That was a really good series to see where he kind of took the game over. But Kenny's a vet, professional, and so I expect him to be able to do those things, to be honest.\" A bonus against Minnesota was the opportunity to get rookie running back Kaleb Johnson involved. Johnson hadn't been used in the Steelers 21-14 win on Sept. 21 at New England after failing to field a kickoff in the Steelers' 31-17 loss to the Seahawks on Sept. 14. The gaffe against Seattle was part of what has been a slow start for Johnson. But the Steelers haven't lost faith in their third-round draft pick from Iowa. Johnson carried six times for 22 yards against the Vikings, the first time he's rushed more than once in a game this season. \"He has the luxury of having two really good veterans that have played a lot in front of him who are selfless and willing to help him in any way they can,\" Faulkner said, referencing Warren and Gainwell. \"Obviously, (Johnson) is a great talent. There's some growth there, he knows that. We all know that and we're just going to keep working toward it because we know we're going to need him to win here down the stretch. \"That was a big boost for",

When they deactivated running back Jaylen Warren in advance of last Sunday's meeting with the Vikings in Dublin, the Steelers knew they'd have to replace their leading rusher and leading receiver through the season's first three weeks. They also knew what they had in running back Kenneth Gainwell. With Warren and his 132 rushing yards and 142 receiving yards sidelined due to a knee injury, Gainwell responded with a career day in the Steelers' 24-21 victory. Gainwell's 19 carries constituted a career-high total, as did his 99 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. His 5.2-yard average per carry was the second-highest he'd achieved in a game in which he'd been asked to carry the ball at least 10 times. Gainwell also had six catches on six targets for 35 receiving yards. His signature series in the estimation of running backs coach Eddie Faulkner was the five-play, 35-yard drive that produced a touchdown and a 21-6 Steelers' lead with 2:23 left in the third quarter. The possession commenced after an interception and 13-yard return by outside linebacker T.J. Watt. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers hit tight end Darnell Washington for 8 yards to start the march. After that, Gainwell carried for gains of 7, 6, 10 and 4 yards on the way to the end zone. \"You know, that drive, we went down and scored after T.J.'s interception, (Gainwell) was doing a really good job of controlling the game,\" Faulkner said. \"You saw some patience come out on him. Whether it was gap-scheme or zone-scheme he was being patient, letting the blocks develop for him and then bursting through the hole. \"That was a really good series to see where he kind of took the game over. But Kenny's a vet, professional, and so I expect him to be able to do those things, to be honest.\" A bonus against Minnesota was the opportunity to get rookie running back Kaleb Johnson involved. Johnson hadn't been used in the Steelers 21-14 win on Sept. 21 at New England after failing to field a kickoff in the Steelers' 31-17 loss to the Seahawks on Sept. 14. The gaffe against Seattle was part of what has been a slow start for Johnson. But the Steelers haven't lost faith in their third-round draft pick from Iowa. Johnson carried six times for 22 yards against the Vikings, the first time he's rushed more than once in a game this season. \"He has the luxury of having two really good veterans that have played a lot in front of him who are selfless and willing to help him in any way they can,\" Faulkner said, referencing Warren and Gainwell. \"Obviously, (Johnson) is a great talent. There's some growth there, he knows that. We all know that and we're just going to keep working toward it because we know we're going to need him to win here down the stretch. \"That was a big boost for",

Four plays later, Russell Wilson tossed an 11-yard TD to George Pickens, cutting New York's lead to 15-13 and starting a run of 31 consecutive points for the Steelers.

But Greg Zuerlein's attempt was blocked by defensive lineman Dean Lowry, turning the Jets away without points. It marked the third consecutive game in which the Steelers blocked a kick, tying a team record for most blocks in consecutive games and blocks in a single season. _Week 8, 4:58 3rd quarter, against New York Giants_ The Steelers were locked in a 9-9 tie with the visiting Giants when an Alex Highsmith sack helped force New York to punt. Austin fielded the punt at his own 27 on the right hash, cut all the way back across the field, picking up a block on the edge from Rodney Williams and sprinted up the sideline for a 73-yard punt return touchdown. It was the Steelers' first punt return for a score since 2019. On the Steelers' next possession, Austin would catch a 29-yard touchdown pass from Wilson, helping the Steelers to their sixth win. _Week 8, 3:03 4th quarter, against New York Giants_ With the Steelers leading 26-18, Wilson fumbled on a scramble, with the Giants recovering at the Pittsburgh 37. But with the Giants at the 19, Watt whipped his block at the snap, hit quarterback Daniel Jones and forced him to fumble, recovering the loose ball himself. The Steelers would run the clock down to two minutes while moving out to midfield before punting. And Bishop would record his third interception in two weeks in the closing seconds to seal the win for the Steelers. ## Related Content [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_auto/steelers/rj2x6jlmd2sgprf4yxxo.jpg)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Winning while building**\\\\ \\\\ The Steelers head into their bye week with a 3-1 record](https://www.steelers.com/news/winning-while-building \"Winning while building\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/i7btzicosviyf83wurca.png)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Brandin Echols**\\\\ \\\\ Learn more about Brandin Echols in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-brandin-echols \"Five Fast Facts: Brandin Echols\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/hxpq5fwt6jwfdmbzs7m5.png)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Darius Slay**\\\\ \\\\ Learn more about Darius Slay in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-darius-slay \"Five Fast Facts: Darius Slay\") [![](https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_mobile/t_lazy/f_png/steelers/gfbre5360twmbebktymu.png)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Kaleb Johnson**\\\\ \\\\ Learn more about Kaleb Johnson in this edition of Five Fast Facts](https://www.steelers.com/news/five-fast-facts-kaleb-johnson \"Five Fast Facts: Kaleb Johnson\") [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **The voice of experience**\\\\ \\\\ Seumalo's play, presence counted upon to steady youngsters up front](https://www.steelers.com/news/the-voice-of-experience \"The voice of experience\") [![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\\\\ \\\\ news\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ **Five Fast Facts: Malik Harrison**\\\\",

The house was built in the 1860s, original architect unknown. After modifications by Pittsburgh architect Andrew Peebles, it was renamed \"Clayton\". Further remodeling of the house was done in 1892 by Pittsburgh architect [Frederick J. Osterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_J._Osterling \"Frederick J. Osterling\"). The Playhouse was constructed in 1897 to designs by architects [Alden & Harlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alden_%26_Harlow \"Alden & Harlow\"). The house served as the Fricks' primary residence from 1883 to 1905.

Visit the Fort Pitt Block House, Frick Building and many more during your visit. ## Downtown ### Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail Complex Stunningly beautiful. Singularly graceful. A symphony of arches. Considered by many to be the leading architect of the 19th century, Henry Hobson Richardson's 19th century neo-medieval design combines stunning brickwork and crisp granite detail. An outdoor fountain in the courtyard park highlights the magnificent riverfront structure, while the Bridge of Sighs (mirroring the Venice original) --at one time used to transport prisoners--connects the Courthouse to the former jail. What Richardson considered his best work remains among elite architectural company in Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle. ### BNY Mellon Born out of a merger between The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation, The Bank of New York Mellon has a substantial Pittsburgh presence. It's the oldest banking corporation in the nation - tracing its roots back to Alexander Hamilton. BNY Mellon Center is 55 stories and was completed in 1983. It is the second-tallest building in the city, boasts an eight-sided design and a rooftop heliport. On a clear day it is possible to spot the building from as far as 50 miles away. ### Fort Pitt Block House The Block House is the oldest structure in the City of Pittsburgh and the last vestige of the British Empire, built here in 1764 by the English Army. Much of its original fabric is still intact and it is open and free to the public year-round as an historic landmark. The Block House is the focal point in Point State Park where the three rivers of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny, the Ohio and the Monongahela, meet. ### Frick Building The Frick Building (1901-02), the first of industrialist Henry Clay Frick's architectural ventures on Grant Street, Downtown. In 1903, Leslie's Weekly judged it \"the finest office building in the world,\" and no wonder: Daniel Burnham gave the coke and steel king a vertical version of the White City, a neo-classical tower with a dazzling white, T-shaped marble lobby, clean and crisp as a new dollar bill; bronze lions flanking the entrance; and John La Farge's stained glass window, \"Fortune and Her Wheel,\" above a marble bust of Frick installed after his death in 1919. ### Fifth Avenue Place Home to Highmark, Pennsylvania's largest health insurer, Fifth Avenue Place was completed in 1988 and has 31 floors. The structure is made of a unique granite frame for roughly 450 feet and then collapses inward in a pyramid shape for another 124-foot-tall roof structure. Protruding from the top of the skyscraper is a 178-foot-tall mast. Despite its rounded appearance, the 13-story structure is actually 12-sided and measures four feet in diameter. ### Gulf Tower Rising 44 stories above the Downtown skyline,",

Arrow pointing up: After some struggles at the outset of the season, the Steelers' defense has begun to find its collective stride. \"We're getting there,\" defensive coordinator Teryl Austin assessed today. Just as Austin suspected the defense would all along. \"I've said it, I know we hadn't played well early but I know we have enough good players and that things will start trending in the right direction,\" Austin continued. \"I think we took a step forward (last Sunday), absolutely. But we also know we left a lot out there and there's a lot of room to improve. \"I really love the way our guys competed and performed last week and we know we can be better.\" The Steelers amassed six sacks, 14 quarterback hits, two interceptions and eight passes defensed in last Sunday's 24-21 win over the Vikings in Dublin. Moving forward, \"better\" would include eliminating occasional breakdowns in coverage, specifically the one that resulted in an 81-yard, catch-and-run chunk play to the Steelers' 1-yard line from Vikings quarterback Carson Wentz to uncovered wide receiver Jordan Addison that helped Minnesota eventually close to within three points with 2:08 left in regulation. \"I'm gonna take that one,\" Austin insisted. \"We were struggling with who was in the game and I probably made a call that probably wasn't simple enough for everybody, so that's on me. If that ever happens again, if we have some attrition the way we did, the way it happened, I gotta give our guys something that's way more simple and that they can line up and play. It may not be the best defense but it'll be something where we won't have a chance to blow it. \"Our guys played great and again, that last one is on me and I'll make sure that doesn't happen again.\" The Steelers had lost cornerbacks Jalen Ramsey and Brandin Echols to injury by that juncture. Echols returned for the final defensive series, which began at the Minnesota 20 with 1:02 left in the fourth quarter and ended when the Vikings threw an incomplete pass on fourth-and-17 from the Minnesota 32 with 14 seconds to play. The Wentz-to-Addison dagger may have been much more damaging had inside linebacker Payton Wilson not sprinted down the field and tackled Addison in bounds at the Steelers' 1. The Vikings ended up requiring an additional four plays to score in the wake of Wilson's relentless hustle. \"It was unbelievable,\" Austin said. \"It's probably the difference in the game. You make them run three plays. You make them burn time off the clock. And then if they do, and they did, get an opportunity to go back down, now you're talking about a minute less time to try to get into field goal range. \"So it was a huge play. It's why we talk to our guys all the time, that's why we run to the ball. We talk",

When they deactivated running back Jaylen Warren in advance of last Sunday's meeting with the Vikings in Dublin, the Steelers knew they'd have to replace their leading rusher and leading receiver through the season's first three weeks. They also knew what they had in running back Kenneth Gainwell. With Warren and his 132 rushing yards and 142 receiving yards sidelined due to a knee injury, Gainwell responded with a career day in the Steelers' 24-21 victory. Gainwell's 19 carries constituted a career-high total, as did his 99 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. His 5.2-yard average per carry was the second-highest he'd achieved in a game in which he'd been asked to carry the ball at least 10 times. Gainwell also had six catches on six targets for 35 receiving yards. His signature series in the estimation of running backs coach Eddie Faulkner was the five-play, 35-yard drive that produced a touchdown and a 21-6 Steelers' lead with 2:23 left in the third quarter. The possession commenced after an interception and 13-yard return by outside linebacker T.J. Watt. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers hit tight end Darnell Washington for 8 yards to start the march. After that, Gainwell carried for gains of 7, 6, 10 and 4 yards on the way to the end zone. \"You know, that drive, we went down and scored after T.J.'s interception, (Gainwell) was doing a really good job of controlling the game,\" Faulkner said. \"You saw some patience come out on him. Whether it was gap-scheme or zone-scheme he was being patient, letting the blocks develop for him and then bursting through the hole. \"That was a really good series to see where he kind of took the game over. But Kenny's a vet, professional, and so I expect him to be able to do those things, to be honest.\" A bonus against Minnesota was the opportunity to get rookie running back Kaleb Johnson involved. Johnson hadn't been used in the Steelers 21-14 win on Sept. 21 at New England after failing to field a kickoff in the Steelers' 31-17 loss to the Seahawks on Sept. 14. The gaffe against Seattle was part of what has been a slow start for Johnson. But the Steelers haven't lost faith in their third-round draft pick from Iowa. Johnson carried six times for 22 yards against the Vikings, the first time he's rushed more than once in a game this season. \"He has the luxury of having two really good veterans that have played a lot in front of him who are selfless and willing to help him in any way they can,\" Faulkner said, referencing Warren and Gainwell. \"Obviously, (Johnson) is a great talent. There's some growth there, he knows that. We all know that and we're just going to keep working toward it because we know we're going to need him to win here down the stretch. \"That was a big boost for",

He made the switch at quarterback from veteran Mitch Trubisky to rookie Kenny Pickett. Pickett gave the offense a bit of a spark, but also made some rookie mistakes, as the Steelers fell, 24-20, to the New York Jets here at Acrisure Stadium. Trubisky was 7 of 13 for 84 yards and a tipped interception, but had led the Steelers (1-3) to just six points in the first half as they trailed 10-6. He also was sacked three times. Pickett finished 10 of 13 for 120 yards but three interceptions. He also scored a pair of rushing touchdowns to help set up a day in which the Steelers rushed for 119 yards, including a season-high 74 on 18 carries for Najee Harris. \"We just thought we needed a spark,\" Tomlin said. \"We didn't do much in the first half, not enough offensively, and thought he could provide a spark for us.\" # [GAME PHOTOS: Week 4 vs. Jets](https://www.steelers.com/photos/game-photos-week-4-vs-jets) Game action photos from the Steelers' Week 4 game against the New York Jets at Acrisure Stadium 1 / 123 Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Myles Jack (51) during a regular season game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the New York Jets, Sunday, Oct. 2, 2022 in Pittsburgh, PA.

Black originally signed with the Indianapolis Colts as an undrafted free agent following the 2021 NFL Draft. He spent time on the Colts practice squad in 2021, but was released before the end of the season. Black was signed by the New York Jets practice squad late in the 2021 season and was elevated for the final game of the year, making two catches for 10 yards. He spent part of the 2022 season on the Jets practice squad as well. The Ravens added Black to their practice squad in 2023. Black spent one season at the University of Texas where he appeared in eight games in 2020, finishing with 10 receptions for 240 yards and one touchdown. Before joining the Longhorns, he spent three years at Michigan where he appeared in 21 games, starting nine. He finished with 40 receptions for 507 yards and two touchdowns. To make room for him on the roster, the team released defensive lineman Jonathan Marshall. **Tuesday, July 30** **Steelers sign multiple players:** The Steelers signed cornerback Kyler McMichael and tight end Matt Sokol. McMichael originally signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent following the 2022 NFL Draft. He spent the 2022 season on the Buffalo Bills practice squad and also spent time this offseason with the Arizona Cardinals after they claimed him off waivers. McMichael played college football at the University of North Carolina where he appeared in 21 games over two seasons. He recorded 44 tackles, 34 of them solo stops, one tackle for a loss, eight passes defensed and an interception. Sokol originally signed with the Los Angeles Chargers following the 2019 NFL Draft. He has spent time on the practice squads of the Chargers, Jacksonville Jaguars, Detroit Lions and New England patriots. He also spent time on the Chargers active roster. Sokol played college football at Michigan State where he appeared in 52 games. He had 31 receptions for 348 yards and two touchdowns. The team also released defensive back Josiah Scott and receiver Marquez Callaway. **Wednesday, July 24** **Moves to open camp:** The Steelers placed linebacker Cole Holcomb and defensive lineman Dean Lowry on the Active/Physically Unable to Perform List to open training camp. In addition, running back/kick return Cordarrelle Patterson was placed on the Active/NFI List (Non-Football Injury List). Holcomb was originally placed on the Reserve/Injured List on Nov. 6, 2023, after he was injured in the Steelers win over the Tennessee Titans on Thursday Night Football. He had been a huge force in the middle for the defense, starting all eight games prior to his injury. Holcomb talked about his injury during the team's OTAs, telling the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette he was coming along. \"It's been a grind.

As they were from Austria, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, England and Brazil, to name just a few among numerous other exotic points of origin represented in Ireland for the spectacle that was Steelers-Vikings last Sunday. As anticipated, most were Steelers fans. What was surprising was how many were there for the game, not necessarily Terrible Towel waving or \"Renegade\" or anything else that had more to do with entertainment and fan engagement than it did the actual playing of American football. One Brazilian, in particular, betrayed the depth of understanding and knowledge of the game many Steelers fans from all over the world brought with them to the Emerald Isle, even those who showed up despite not in possession of tickets. \"They need to invest more in the offensive line.\" He was reminded offensive tackles Broderick Jones and Troy Fautanu are both former first-round picks and center Zach Frazier is a former second-round selection, but was still not deterred. The boys from Brazil would like to focus on the continued development of the offensive line, and that wasn't the only time such nuance and detail were passionately discussed in an overflowing pub where someone was singing Cranberries songs and the decor included a \"John F. Kennedy for President\" poster from 1960 on one wall and a bronze representation of James Joyce in front of another. Welcome to Dublin. ——— This wasn't, after further review, where the streets had no name. And the names were all recognizable to the Steelers fans crowding up and down the cobblestones of the Temple Bar district, touring the Guinness Storehouse or visiting Christ Church Cathedral, Trinity College or any of the numerous other local attractions. The nameplates and numbers on the backs of authentic jerseys were omnipresent. \"Roethlisberger 7,\" and \"Bettis 36\" and \"Greene 75\" and \"Russell 34,\" to name just a few; almost every era of Steelers football, it seemed, was on display. And it wasn't just fans celebrating their favorite players. A host of former Steelers were there in the flesh. The group included Bettis, Mark Bruener, James Farrior, Brett Keisel, Carnell Lake, Maurice Pouncey, Roethlisberger, John Stallworth, Max Starks and Ike Taylor. They enthusiastically showed up for events such as football camps (including one in Belfast, Northern Ireland), Q&A's at Fitzsimons Pub, a flag football event at the U.S. Ambassador's residence and a tailgate. The ex-players sampled a pint or two and served as good will ambassadors throughout. They didn't want to miss this, either. Fitzsimons served as an unofficial headquarters for Steelers fans and hosted broadcasts on Steelers Nation Radio and WDVE-FM in Pittsburgh, the flagship station on the Steelers Audio Network, and Steelers fans responded. According to Romy Carroll, manager of sales and marketing for Fitzsimons, business was up about 50 percent over an average weekend and surpassed annual events such as St. Patrick's Day and the All-Ireland Finals for rugby and Gaelic football (which draw",

Steelers fans saw on Sunday what DK Metcalf brings to the offense when he broke loose for an 80-yard touchdown reception against the Minnesota Vikings, speeding down the sidelines for the score. Receivers coach Zach Azzanni jokingly said he would like to take credit for Metcalf's yards after catch because they put so much focus on it every practice, but he said it was all Metcalf. \"We work on it a lot. We emphasize it a lot, every drill that we do, every route,\" said Azzanni. \"I show film of it throughout the week, of other teams, of us. We talk about all of that. \"I would love to tell you that DK was all coaching, but that one, it was him. I got a lot teasing about that. But we do coach it, we emphasize it just like everyone else in the league does it, but those guys make it breathe.\" And what Metcalf has brought to the offense, in the words of Azzanni is a breath of fresh air. Metcalf, who was acquired in a trade with the Seattle Seahawks this offseason, has a business-like approach to the game, wanting nothing more than to win every week. \"It's been a pleasure,\" said Azzanni of working with Metcalf. \"It's a breath of fresh air. He's great to work with. He's a true pro. He does anything you ask him to do. He's a team guy, which is really cool. \"He gets as excited when other guys make plays as he does when he makes a play. And when you have a room like that with a lot of guys and your bell cow is wired like that, it's a pleasure to coach. \"It's fun to go in the meeting room. No one's too prideful to take corrections. So, it's been a really good addition having him there.\" It's an attitude Azzanni said permeates not just with Metcalf, but throughout the entire receiver room, including Calvin Austin III, Roman Wilson, Scotty Miller and Ben Skowronek. And their performance reflects that. \"These guys are just doing what they're asked to do, which is cool,\" said Azzanni. \"The goal is to win football games. If they block 40 times, they block 40 times We throw 40 times, we throw 40 and none of them say a word. \"They're a very unselfish group. It's a really good room. So, I feel good about where they are.\" Another player who epitomizes that unselfish approach is Skowronek. He might not get the numbers in the receiving game, but he contributes in ways that are hard to measure. \"Ben's the kind of guy that you don't want on other teams,\" said Azzanni. \"You like it on your team. He's a guy that does all the dirty work. He is the goon, if you will. And he is a sneaky good receiver too.",

Prior Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra Fellows have experienced substantial career advancement as a result of the fellowship: - **2019-2022** Fellow Shantanique Moore, flute, won a position as the African American Orchestra Fellow with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra for their 2022-23 season. Ms. Moore was named the eighth OTPAAM Fellow for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons and was the first Paul J. Ross Fellow during the 2021-2022 season. - **2017-2019** Fellow Joshua Jones, percussion, won a position with the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra as Principal Percussion during the first year of the fellowship. He previously served as Principal Percussion of the Kansas City Symphony and now serves as Principal Percussion of the Grant Park Orchestra. - **2015-2017** Fellow Torrell Moss, percussion, was accepted as an Artist Diploma candidate at Frost School of Music at the University of Miami, as a result of his fellowship. Moss has recently held positions with the Rainey Institute and Ashland Symphony Orchestra in Ohio, and performed in M.U.S.i.C.’s Stars in the Classics garden concert in 2020. - **2013-2015** Fellow Adedeji Ogunfolu, horn, won a position with the San Antonio Symphony during the first year of the fellowship. He joined the Pacific Symphony as second horn in 2018, and has been appointed as Professor of Horn at the University of California, Irvine. - **2011-2013** Fellow Ryan Murphy, cello, won a position with the San Antonio Symphony in 2012 and is currently in his ninth season with the orchestra. - **2007-2008** Fellow Geoffrey Johnson, oboe, was the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s first OTPAAM Fellow. He won acting second oboe of the Detroit Symphony from 2014-2017, and he is currently a private lessons teacher and guest oboist in major orchestras across the country. * * * The Paul J. Ross Fellowship is made possible, in part, thanks to generous funding from the Arts, Equity, & Education Fund; the PA Department of Education with support from State Senator Camera Bartolotta; Hans & Leslie Fleischner; Anonymous Friends of the Orchestra; and EQT Foundation. The Arts, Equity, & Education Fund and Leslie and the late Hans Fleischner also seek to inspire others who believe in the mission of the Paul J. Ross Fellowship Program by pledging funds of an additional $150,000 to be matched by new and increased gifts to the Pittsburgh Symphony specifically for this program through the 2025/2026 season. If successfully matched, the financial need for the program will be almost fully met for all four years. # Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra Menu",

Since 2008, the orchestra's music director is [Manfred Honeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Honeck \"Manfred Honeck\"). The orchestra's current president and [CEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer \"Chief executive officer\") is Melia Tourangeau. ## History \\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")\\] ### 1895–1910: Founding and early history \\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: 1895–1910: Founding and early history\")\\] The orchestra was founded by the Pittsburgh Arts Society with conductor [Frederic Archer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Archer \"Frederic Archer\") in 1895, who brought with him a number of musicians from the [Boston Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Symphony_Orchestra \"Boston Symphony Orchestra\") and led the PSO in its first concert the following year. In 1898, [Victor Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Herbert \"Victor Herbert\") was chosen to lead the orchestra.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-1) The orchestra traveled at a more frequent rate under Herbert's tenure, performing in [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston \"Boston\"), Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Canada.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-2) Its personnel included such musicians as [Luigi von Kunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_von_Kunits \"Luigi von Kunits\") (later the first conductor of the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Symphony_Orchestra \"Toronto Symphony Orchestra\")) as concertmaster, first violinist Frederick William Stahlberg,[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-3) second violinist [John Stepan Zamecnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stepan_Zamecnik \"John Stepan Zamecnik\"), assistant principal cello [Gaston Borch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Borch \"Gaston Borch\"), Paul Henneberg as first flute, and Leon Medaer as first clarinet.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-4) Herbert composed two orchestral works that the Pittsburgh Orchestra premiered: his _Suite romantique_ op. 31 (which he also dedicated to the orchestra)[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-5) and the [tone poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_poem \"Tone poem\") _Hero and Leander_ op. 33.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-6) Under Herbert's direction, the Pittsburgh Orchestra played as part of the [Pan-American Exposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-American_Exposition \"Pan-American Exposition\") at the 1901 World's Fair in [Buffalo, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York \"Buffalo, New York\"), for which Herbert had also composed an original work for the exhibition titled \"Panamericana: Morceau Characteristique\" for the Orchestra to perform.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-7) His tenure with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra ended in 1904 because of increasingly strident disagreements with the orchestra's manager, George H. Wilson, who disliked Herbert's populist manner and personally despised him.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-8) When Herbert left the orchestra in 1904, the Symphony Society chose as his successor Austrian conductor [Emil Paur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Paur \"Emil Paur\"). Paur took an intellectual approach to his work and avoided theatrics. Trained as a violinist, he had served as conductor of both the [Boston Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Symphony_Orchestra \"Boston Symphony Orchestra\") and the [New York Philharmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Philharmonic \"New York Philharmonic\"), as well as guest conductor throughout Europe,[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-9) and held the Pittsburgh Orchestra to the same exacting standards. Paur's programs emphasized the classical repertoire and increased the presence of works by [Johannes Brahms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Brahms \"Johannes Brahms\"), whose music was considered too challenging for most audiences at that time. Additionally, Paur clashed with many of the orchestra's musicians when he prohibited them from accepting outside performing engagements and continued to hire mainly European musicians.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-10) Orchestra manager George H. Wilson resigned on December 24, 1906, shortly after the beginning of Paur's third season, saying that his tenure, pride, and pleasure with the orchestra:",

In 1898, [Victor Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Herbert \"Victor Herbert\") was chosen to lead the orchestra.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-1) The orchestra traveled at a more frequent rate under Herbert's tenure, performing in [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston \"Boston\"), Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Canada.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-2) Its personnel included such musicians as [Luigi von Kunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_von_Kunits \"Luigi von Kunits\") (later the first conductor of the [Toronto Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Symphony_Orchestra \"Toronto Symphony Orchestra\")) as concertmaster, first violinist Frederick William Stahlberg,[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-3) second violinist [John Stepan Zamecnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stepan_Zamecnik \"John Stepan Zamecnik\"), assistant principal cello [Gaston Borch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Borch \"Gaston Borch\"), Paul Henneberg as first flute, and Leon Medaer as first clarinet.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-4) Herbert composed two orchestral works that the Pittsburgh Orchestra premiered: his _Suite romantique_ op. 31 (which he also dedicated to the orchestra)[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-5) and the [tone poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_poem \"Tone poem\") _Hero and Leander_ op. 33.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-6) Under Herbert's direction, the Pittsburgh Orchestra played as part of the [Pan-American Exposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-American_Exposition \"Pan-American Exposition\") at the 1901 World's Fair in [Buffalo, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York \"Buffalo, New York\"), for which Herbert had also composed an original work for the exhibition titled \"Panamericana: Morceau Characteristique\" for the Orchestra to perform.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-7) His tenure with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra ended in 1904 because of increasingly strident disagreements with the orchestra's manager, George H. Wilson, who disliked Herbert's populist manner and personally despised him.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-8) When Herbert left the orchestra in 1904, the Symphony Society chose as his successor Austrian conductor [Emil Paur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Paur \"Emil Paur\"). Paur took an intellectual approach to his work and avoided theatrics. Trained as a violinist, he had served as conductor of both the [Boston Symphony Orchestra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Symphony_Orchestra \"Boston Symphony Orchestra\") and the [New York Philharmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Philharmonic \"New York Philharmonic\"), as well as guest conductor throughout Europe,[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-9) and held the Pittsburgh Orchestra to the same exacting standards. Paur's programs emphasized the classical repertoire and increased the presence of works by [Johannes Brahms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Brahms \"Johannes Brahms\"), whose music was considered too challenging for most audiences at that time. Additionally, Paur clashed with many of the orchestra's musicians when he prohibited them from accepting outside performing engagements and continued to hire mainly European musicians.[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Symphony_Orchestra#cite_note-10) Orchestra manager George H. Wilson resigned on December 24, 1906, shortly after the beginning of Paur's third season, saying that his tenure, pride, and pleasure with the orchestra:",

He began studying piano in his native Berlin at the age of six before the rise of the Nazi regime sent his family first to Paris and later to Los Angeles. In his teenage years he began composing, arranging and conducting film scores. The four-time Academy Award Winner developed an equally successful career as a Jazz pianist before turning to conducting in 1960. In 1968 he was appointed Principal Conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. He held that post until 1979, having already assumed the Music Directorship of the PSO in 1976. Previn often brought jazz to the concert hall. In February 1977, the PSO and Previn made their national debut on PBS with eight specials, \"Previn and the Pittsburgh.\" Alcoa sponsored the award-winning series, which ran for three years. **The choice of Previn** is a great one. He is a man not afraid of mixing new works with old and his shaping of programs for the orchestra should offer some of the best variety seen here in years. - _Pittsburgh Post-Gazette_, July 21, 1974 **After the two-hour, intensively experienced concert,** one is ready to believe that the Pittsburgh Symphony musicians can play anything: rococo, classical, late romantic and modern music with the same animated accuracy. - _Der Tagesspiegel_, Berlin ## 1984-1996 ### The Maazel Years Long acknowledged to be one of America's great orchestras, the PSO developed an unrivaled international following during its years under Lorin Maazel. The Orchestra gained further stature as Maazel led tours of Europe, Asia, and the Americas, added first-rank players to vital positions, and programmed season-long retrospectives that appealed to audiences and critics alike. Following Previn's departure in 1984, Maazel agreed to act as Music Consultant while the Orchestra sought a permanent Music Director. He was offered and accepted that position in 1988, having already dazzled the world and won the hearts of the players in the course of numerous guest appearances and three acclaimed tours. For Maazel, the journey back to Pittsburgh was a homecoming. His family settled here while he was still a young child so he could continue to study with his conducting teacher, Vladimir Bakaleinikov, who had become Associate Conductor of the PSO in 1939. Maazel later joined the Orchestra as a violinist and apprentice conductor while studying at the University of Pittsburgh. His career soon took him to Europe where in 1960 he became the first American invited to direct at the Bayreuth Festival. He went on to become Music Director of the Deutsche Oper, The Cleveland Orchestra, the Orchestre National de France, and the Vienna Opera before returning to Pittsburgh. In 1993 he assumed an additional music directorship, as artistic head of the Symphony Orchestra of the Bavarian Radio in Munich. The musical legacy of Maazel's artistic leadership is an Orchestra built upon the multifaceted talents of virtuosic players. For years to come, the high artistic standards inspired by this greatest of living American conductors will be upheld within the Orchestra. Also under Maestro",

Ross, the violinist who, in 1965, was the first African American musician to receive a full-time contract from the Pittsburgh Symphony. The legacy of Paul J. Ross is notable for nurturing, mentoring, and supporting young musicians, and his devotion to sharing his joy of music. The fellowship program was begun in the 2007-2008 season to promote professional training for musicians enabling the field to better reflect the communities and audiences that orchestras serve. Fellows work closely alongside members of the Pittsburgh Symphony to train and prepare for professional auditions and opportunities, with substantial financial and professional development support, and robust mentorship in a universally welcoming environment. ## Key components of the Fellowship - The Fellowship runs for two PSO seasons (starting each September). - Compensation and Benefits: - Minimum annual pay each season is equivalent to 21 weeks at orchestra weekly scale. - Single coverage on PSO medical, dental, instrument insurance, life and accident insurance plans. - Reimbursement of up to $8,000 per season in audition and professional development expenses such as lessons, travel, hotel, sheet music, AFM membership, etc. - Allowance for relocation to and from Pittsburgh at start and end of Fellowship - Fellows play a minimum of 100 services with the PSO across all program types (Classical Subscription, Pops, Education, Community Outreach), scheduled collaboratively to accommodate auditions and related preparation, as well as outside professional opportunities. - Fellows playing more than 112 services receive additional compensation at the extra musician rate (1/8 minimum orchestra weekly scale per-service). - Annual pay includes an allowance for dedicated study time. - Fellows have the ability and opportunity to tailor their experience to their own specific needs, including: - Mentorship from and mock auditions with members of the PSO - Time on stage at Heinz Hall to take lessons or for personal practice - Opportunity to observe PSO member auditions for insight on the audition process - Working with the Learning and Community Engagement",

My dad is 100% Kenyan and 100% awesome. My mom is a black-American and my hero!” – Joan Mukogosi, a junior at Winchester Thurston How 20 high school students spent part of their summer doing what many adults probably wouldn’t dare—talk openly about race. By Amy Whipple On a large floor map of the world, 15-year-old Nova Fox plants her black sneakers on India. She’s petite but commanding of her audience of mostly peers, many of them strangers, gathered together inside RACE: Are We So Different?, an exhibition on view at Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Teens explore RACE: Are We So Different? Photos: Amber Niedomys “My family started out in India,” she says, hopping west over the Middle East, landing squarely on Egypt. “They went on a pilgrimage,” she continues. “That’s how it started out that they got to Egypt and were enslaved and the word gypsy came about.” She inches her feet forward. “And then they went aaaaaaaall the way to Europe. Then racism started getting really bad and World War I is starting, so my family came to America.” She looks across the Atlantic Ocean. “It’s just really cool,” she says with a pause, “to put it into perspective how far they actually went.” A sophomore at Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School in the Beaver County borough of Midland, Fox is one of 20 regional high school students who spent a chunk of their summer vacation helping to develop the museum’s Youth Summit on Race and Identity, an interactive program slated for October 22 that’s expected to draw dozens of area students and teachers. Museum educators initiated the idea of a program for teens by teens as a way to learn what’s important to young people about race and identity by getting them to talk to each other about it, something previous generations still haven’t mastered. RACE, a collaboration of the American Anthropological Association and the Science Museum of Minnesota, is billed as a conversation starter, and it’s gotten people talking, sharing, and educating each other in some 30 venues around the country. “Some people may lack the skills or the interest or the vocabulary or the courage to talk about race,” explains Cecile Shellman, communications specialist at the Museum of Natural History. “This exhibition really does invite people in overt and unconscious ways to talk about race.” Part of the museum’s challenge is to keep the conversation going long after the exhibition leaves Pittsburgh—and, ultimately, to affect measureable change in the community. Over the summer, with support from The Hive Fund for Connected Learning at The Sprout Fund, the museum teamed up with the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh, The Labs at Carnegie Libraries of Pittsburgh, Literary Arts Boom (a creative writing lab for Pittsburgh youth), and sister museum The Andy Warhol Museum to host a series of workshops designed to empower teens to develop content",

In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\") was started, and in 1787, the [Pittsburgh Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh \"University of Pittsburgh\") was chartered. Unrest during the [Whiskey Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion \"Whiskey Rebellion\") of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the [Appalachian Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains \"Appalachian Mountains\") or through the [Great Lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes \"Great Lakes\"). [Fort Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Pitt_(Pennsylvania) \"Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)\") (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the [Northwest Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territory \"Northwest Territory\"). ### 19th century \\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pittsburgh&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: 19th century\")\\] Further information: [Pennsylvania in the American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_in_the_American_Civil_War \"Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\") [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Monongahela_River_Scene_Pittsburgh_PA_1857.jpg/250px-Monongahela_River_Scene_Pittsburgh_PA_1857.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Monongahela_River_Scene_Pittsburgh_PA_1857.jpg) The [Monongahela River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monongahela_River \"Monongahela River\") and its surroundings in 1857 [![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Pittsburgh_1874_Otto_Krebs.jpg/250px-Pittsburgh_1874_Otto_Krebs.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pittsburgh_1874_Otto_Krebs.jpg) [Lithograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography \"Lithography\") of Pittsburgh by [Otto Krebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Krebs \"Otto Krebs\") (before 1874) The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the [Lewis and Clark Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition \"Lewis and Clark Expedition\").[\\[38\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-38) Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when [Meriwether Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meriwether_Lewis \"Meriwether Lewis\") purchased a [keelboat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keelboat \"Keelboat\") that would later be used to ascend the [Missouri River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River \"Missouri River\").[\\[39\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#cite_note-39) The [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\") cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. In the 1830s, many [Welsh people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_people \"Welsh people\") from the [Merthyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merthyr \"Merthyr\") steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the [Merthyr Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merthyr_Rising \"Merthyr Rising\"). By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the [Allegheny Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_Mountains \"Allegheny Mountains\"). The [Great Fire of Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_Pittsburgh \"Great Fire of Pittsburgh\") destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the [Great Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland) \"Great Famine (Ireland)\").

There were active stations of the [Underground Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad \"Underground Railroad\") in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels.

The company was founded by five women who established the Pittsburgh Opera Society in 1939, making possible the inaugural performance of [Offenbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Offenbach \"Jacques Offenbach\")'s _[Les Contes d'Hoffmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Contes_d%27Hoffmann \"Les Contes d'Hoffmann\")_ at the [Carnegie Music Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Music_Hall \"Carnegie Music Hall\") in March 1940.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-3) The first director of the company was Richard Karp, from 1942 to 1977. His daughter Barbara Karp took over her father's duties during his final illness. James DeBlasis then served as interim artistic director after the resignation of Barbara Karp. In 1983, [Tito Capobianco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Capobianco \"Tito Capobianco\") became Pittsburgh Opera's general director, holding this position until 1997.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-Croan1-4) From 1997 to 2000, Capobianco was the company's artistic director, before leaving in 2000.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-5) Mark Weinstein became general director of Pittsburgh Opera in 1999, after starting as executive director in 1997.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-Croan1-4) During his tenure, he presided over an increase in the company's endowment from US $4 million to US $16 million, as well as the retirement of US $2.5 million in debt.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-6) Weinstein also presided over the addition of an extra production during the company season, 5 productions as opposed to 4, from the 2001-2002 season to the 2003-2004 season.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-7) Weinstein announced his resignation as Pittsburgh Opera's general director effective February 1, 2008.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Opera#cite_note-8) Artistic Director Christopher Hahn was appointed as [General Director](http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1452015/pittsburgh_opera_appoints_christopher_hahn_its_general_director/index.html) in June 2008.

Intimidated by opera? Don't be! Let's debunk some common opera myths together! If you’ve never been to the opera before, you may have some misconceptions. Don't worry, you're not alone! So let's shake off your preconceptions and learn what going to the opera is really like... Come as you are or glam it up! On weeknights people often show up in what they wore to the office that day, and on Fridays and Sundays, we see everything from dressy to jeans. On Saturdays – opening nights – some like to wear a suit or step out in a special dress. But just wear whatever makes you feel comfortable! _Everyone in this photo is dressed perfectly for the opera! (Photo credit: David Bachman)_ Tickets to Pittsburgh Opera's mainstage shows at the Benedum and Byham start at only $15... children and teens can even get in at half that price. That's less than a movie ticket and some popcorn! There are even discounts for [groups of 6+](https://pittsburghopera.org/tickets/groups-tickets?hsLang=en), [students](https://www.pittsburghopera.org/tickets/student-tickets/cheapseats/?hsLang=en), [20-Something Tuesdays](https://pittsburghopera.org/tickets/promotions-and-discounts/?hsLang=en) and more. English texts are always projected above the stage, just like subtitles at the movies. While many operas are in Italian, German, or French, there are many in English too. You'll understand every word! Do you think sword fights are boring? What about dancing, poisonings, secret plots, epic romances, or twist endings? Operas have these in spades! That's why the term \"operatic\" has come to mean \"dramatic to the nth degree.\" _These two will slice your notions of \"boring\" to threads! (Photo credit: David Bachman)_ Operas come in all shapes and sizes! The shortest opera we know of is 13 minutes long, and the longest one takes 7 days! You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under \"Details and Resources.\" Many operas are the same length as any musical or play, with an intermission or two along the way. Just like music has changed a lot in the last 400 years, opera has too! While almost all operas make use",

Skowronek was signed by the Steelers right before Week 1 in 2024, getting on a moving train and not having the luxury of getting to know his teammates in an offseason setting. This year, through the offseason and training camp, he was able to build a bond with them that continues to grow. \"I think Latrobe was awesome this year to spend time with the guys,\" said Skowronek. \"I didn't have that luxury last year. I came in week one, I think I got here on Tuesday and played on Sunday and didn't know the guys' names. My number one priority was learning the playbook. \"But this year I was able to spend all offseason with the guys. Obviously, in Latrobe, there's not much to do out there besides hang out with the guys. Football is a lot more than just X's and O's. It's a relationship game. You've got to be able to trust the guy next to you. You've got to be able to trust the coaches. I think that comes with not only playing together, but hanging out outside practice, outside the facility. That's what I felt like this offseason I accomplished the most.

Miller is not just solid depth at the receiver position, but he is also Austin's backup as a punt returner. While Miller was ready to go, the Vikings were playing from behind and didn't punt the remainder of the game. However, if he is needed moving forward due to Austin's injury, Miller is ready to roll. \"I was going to be there at the end of the game,\" said Miller. \"But we didn't have any opportunities.

Since these great mammals left the land and took to the seas millions of years ago, their survival has been dependent on the evolution of ear structures that are highly specialized for underwater hearing. The dark abyss of the ocean limits eyesight, and water dilutes scent. But sound travels faster and covers greater distances in water than it does in air. So whales must rely primarily on sound for sensory perception, as well as for communication. Sound, therefore, has a profound influence on navigation, feeding, socialization, breeding and other whale behavior. Extant whales, or cetaceans, fall into two groupstoothed whales, or odontocetes, and baleen whales, or mysticetes. Toothed whales are fast swimmers and hunters, and include porpoises, dolphins, killer whales and sperm whales. Baleen whales are filter-feeders that live on zooplanktons and include the blue whale, the humpback whale, the Gray whale and the bowhead whale. Among the many differences between toothed and baleen whales is their specialization for underwater hearing. Long before humans began using sonar for navigation, toothed whales were using this method to “see” their environment. Also known as echolocation, the toothed whale’s biological sonar involves vocalization from the nose, and the reception of the echo in the ear. The whale recycles the air in its complex nasal passage, and produces a high-pitched sound that is beamed out to the environment through the melon, an oil body in its bulging forehead. The sound beamed from the melon into the environment is bounced back to the whale, providing information that helps the animal to accurately decipher its environment. The high-pitched, or ultra-sonic, sound emitted by the whale offers a finer resolution for the echolocation and results in a more accurate perception of its environment. For the ultra-sonic sound to serve toothed whales, their ears developed many structures specialized for hearing high-pitched sounds. By contrast, the baleen whale can vocalize and hear very low-pitched, or infrasonic sound, which can travel great distances and scatter to large areas in water. With infrasonic sound, baleen whales can communicate with each other over geographic areas as large as an ocean basin. These whales are famous for their rich repertoire of songs. The eerie melodies are an integral part of the social fabric of baleen whales, allowing the groups to stay in contact with each other over vast expanses of ocean. How did toothed and baleen whales evolve these entirely different hearing adaptations? The extensive fossil record of extinct whales could have the answer to this intriguing question. The ear bones of all whales are extremely hard and dense, and they are common in whale fossils found in marine sediments. The internal bony structures related to hearing functions are well protected by the dense and hard ear bones, and are often preserved in exquisite condition. The fossilized bony ear structures can provide evidence for the underwater hearing in the extinct whales and offer a window for paleontologists to look",

        "text": "the puck too long, things like that. It’s really just playing more of a pro game, keeping it more simple, and taking opportunities when I can.” Brunicke’s offensive awareness and puck skills came into full effect on Friday’s game against Buffalo. The smooth-skating defenseman scored an impressive goal that had little-to-no angle to get the puck under the bar and past Sabres goaltender Alex Lyon. “I just got some time on the blue line,” said Brunicke on his goal. “I made a play down low and luckily enough I saw some space, and it went in.” At just 19 years old, Brunicke has shown the ability to form his game at an NHL-caliber level with each passing day. “From the start, each day I just came in here with an open mindset of just wanting to get better,” Brunicke said. “You look around the room at all these great players, and it’s so cool to learn from them and see the work they put in and just kind of feed off that.” \\*When attending training camp last season, Sergei Murashov did not see any preseason action. The 2022 fourth-round pick made the most of his appearances this season, posting a .932 save percentage in the three appearances he made. While Murashov’s play has been impressive, what stands out to Muse is the work ethic, as the 21-year-old goalie has been the last one off the ice after practices. \"He’s obviously had a very strong camp, and he’s young,” Muse said. “It’s good to see a young player like that who’s pushing as hard as he is, who’s as competitive as he is, and dedicated as he is.\" After coming to North America last season, Murashov dominated at both the AHL and ECHL levels, saying all of that experience helped him a lot. “I would say the main thing is the work, it paid off,” said Murashov on his biggest takeaway from training camp. “It’s a very enjoyable time. Even if it’s a hard process. Guys are working hard. They challenge you every day. You have to respond. That’s really nice to be (a part of) always.” President of Hockey Operations and GM Kyle Dubas said at the start of training camp that ultimately, the two best goaltenders will make the team come opening night, regardless of contract status. While time will tell how things unfold going into the first game, Murashov is proud of the work he has put in and will continue to put his best foot forward. “I just did my job. I just stop the puck. The decision is up to them. Whatever they will say and (determine), I will take it and just keep going,” Murashov said. ### Youth Movement Shapes Penguins’ Roster Decisions Oct 04, 2025 ### Healthy Novak Looking to Carve Out Role with Penguins Oct 03, 2025 ### Penguins Preseason Lineup Versus Sabres (10.03.25) Oct 02, 2025 ### Penguins Trim Training Camp Roster Oct 02, 2025 ### Musings: Penguins 5, Sabres 3 (Preseason Game 6) Oct 01, 2025 ### Penguins Preseason Lineup Versus Sabres (10.01.25)",

To better understand what makes the machines tick, visitors will discover how robots “see” and “hear,” how they process information, and how they do everything from walk, roll, climb, fly, grasp items, and work with tools. Visitors will even be able to create and test their own robots in an interactive workshop designed to expose younger audiences to a new world of academic and career opportunities in the high-tech field.“Since 1980, the United States has dropped from first to sixth in the world in terms of the number of engineers graduating from our colleges,” notes Ron Baillie, the Science Center’s chief program officer. “Right here in Pittsburgh and across the country, so many high-tech jobs remain open because there aren’t enough people with the skills to fill them. Robotics has been shown as one of the ways to engage youngsters at an early age in a way that can lead to their pursuit of technology-related careers.” In fact, Haas sees roboworld as a breeding ground for future talent to develop and thrive right here in western Pennsylvania. “We want to assume a major role in workforce development with roboworld,” she says. “We are going to concretely connect the exhibit to the major science and technology sectors in this region. The goal is to have children interact with robots here at the Science Center and realize that robots are being made right here in their own backyard.” At CMU, principal scientist and roboworld advisor David Bourne says that the Robotics Institute’s involvement stems from the shared desire to inspire young people to pursue the sciences as a career. “Ultimately, we want our children to become the world’s leading scientists,” says Bourne, who helped design the Science Center’s groundbreaking 1996 robotics exhibit that still travels around the country today. “This partnership allows us at CMU to flow our technology to the Science Center so that students are exposed to robots in a way that will spark their imaginations.” For Kim Amey, the exhibit’s project manager, the goals are even more wide ranging. On board with the project since this past January, she’s connecting with local businesses and educational institutions to broaden roboworld appeal. “We want to make roboworld a major destination for people from around the world who are interested in this type of technology” says Amey. “As a tourist attraction, roboworld is a great economic tool. As a promotional tool, it’s going to be a great way to use local technology to showcase regional innovation.” While roboworld will spotlight the area’s achievements, it will also be the home of some of this planet’s and other planet’s most famous mechanical marvels in a special section of the exhibit dedicated to the Robot Hall of Fame™, which was created by CMU in 2003.­ “It would be great if roboworld had the same effect on a youngster as the planetarium had on Mike Fincke when he was a kid,” says Haas, referring to the Emsworth native who grew up to become a scientist and",
