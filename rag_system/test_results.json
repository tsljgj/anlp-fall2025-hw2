For the minor league team, see [Pittsburgh Allegheny (International Association)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Allegheny_(International_Association) \"Pittsburgh Allegheny (International Association)\"). | Pittsburgh Pirates | The **Pittsburgh Pirates** are an American professional [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball \"Baseball\") team based in [Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh \"Pittsburgh\"). The Pirates compete in [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball \"Major League Baseball\") (MLB) as a member club of the [National League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball) \"National League (baseball)\") (NL) [Central Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central \"National League Central\"). Founded as part of the [American Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_(19th_century) \"American Association (19th century)\") in 1881 under the name the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the [National League East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East \"National League East\") from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series \"World Series\") championships, nine [National League pennants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_League_pennant_winners \"List of National League pennant winners\"), nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the [Wild Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Wild_Card_Game \"Major League Baseball Wild Card Game\"). The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the [inaugural World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1903_World_Series \"1903 World Series\") in 1903 and winning their first title in [1909](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1909_World_Series \"1909 World Series\") behind [Honus Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honus_Wagner \"Honus Wagner\"). The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the [1960 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_World_Series \"1960 World Series\") against the [New York Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees \"New York Yankees\") on a [walk-off home run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run \"Walk-off home run\") by [Bill Mazeroski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mazeroski \"Bill Mazeroski\"), the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in [1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_World_Series \"1971 World Series\") behind [Roberto Clemente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Clemente \"Roberto Clemente\"), the first Latin-American enshrined in the [National Baseball Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame \"National Baseball Hall of Fame\"), and in [1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_World_Series \"1979 World Series\") under the leadership of [Willie Stargell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Stargell \"Willie Stargell\"). Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. The Pirates additionally posted a losing record in 20 consecutive seasons from [1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"1993 Pittsburgh Pirates season\") to [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pittsburgh_Pirates_season \"2012 Pittsburgh Pirates season\"), a record streak in both MLB and the four major North American professional sports leagues.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-5) The Pirates currently have the fifth-longest World Series championship drought, the longest pennant drought in the National League,[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-6) and the longest [League Championship Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_Championship_Series \"League Championship Series\") appearance and division championship drought in all of baseball.

Science and engineering students were now required to take humanities and social sciences courses. ## Post-war Growth: Opening Three New Schools With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study. University culture also changed in 1973, when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms. ### 1948 The Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed the [David A.

This support from the Mellons allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as the [Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/dietrichcollegeofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/). In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech–Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery. 2025 Student Count 16,335 ## CMU's Global Leadership In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists. In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh. Today its global presence includes campuses in [Qatar](https://www.qatar.cmu.edu/) and [Silicon Valley, Calif.](https://sv.cmu.edu/), more than a dozen degree-granting locations, and more than 20 research partnerships in cities and countries such as **Los Angeles**, **New York City**, **Washington, D.C.**, **China**, [Portugal](https://cmuportugal.org/) and [Rwanda](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/). ### 2002 Carnegie Mellon established a [branch campus in Silicon Valley](https://sv.cmu.edu/), the epicenter of the modern technological revolution. ### 2004 [Carnegie University in Qatar (CMU-Q)](https://www.qatar.cmu.edu/) opened its doors with 41 students, offering programs in Business",

At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie once said, \"To die rich is to die disgraced.\" He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. CMU's Origin ## 1900: Initial Funding for Carnegie Technical Schools In 1900, Andrew Carnegie donated $1 million to the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities. The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College. Initial number of students 120 The first Carnegie Technical Schools class was admitted in 1906. Degrees Introduced ## 1912: Carnegie Tech Grants Bachelor's Degrees Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools changed its name to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or \"Carnegie Tech\", and began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts. Carnegie Tech set the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. First U.S. Drama Class 18 actors The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. Investment in Expansion ## Early 20th Century Progress During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th-century campus designed in the Beaux Arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him. Humanities Requirement 25 % of curriculum With the goal of understanding societal needs, the Carnegie Plan began in 1938. Science and engineering students were now required to take humanities and social sciences courses. ## Post-war Growth: Opening Three New Schools With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study. University culture also changed",

After five mostly mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first [A.A. team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_North_American_professional_sports_teams \"Major North American professional sports teams\") to switch to the older [National League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball) \"National League (baseball)\") in 1887.[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-11) During the winter prior to the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the [Players' League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Players%27_League \"Players' League\")'s [Pittsburgh Burghers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Burghers \"Pittsburgh Burghers\"). The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also signed highly regarded second baseman [Lou Bierbauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Bierbauer \"Lou Bierbauer\"), who had previously played with the A.A.'s [Philadelphia Athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics_(American_Association) \"Philadelphia Athletics (American Association)\"). Although the Athletics failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was \"piratical\".[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-12) This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly \"piratical\" act gained them the occasional nickname \"Pirates\" from newspapers around the country, starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with even Pittsburgh newspapers.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-13) The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912.

Early on, the Pirates organization finished no higher than 2nd in either league’s standings, but their fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from the [Louisville Colonels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Colonels \"Louisville Colonels\"), who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.)[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-TBT-14) Among those players was [Honus Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honus_Wagner \"Honus Wagner\"), who would become one of the first players inducted to the [Baseball Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_Hall_of_Fame \"Baseball Hall of Fame\").

The Pirates returned to the World Series in [1909](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1909_World_Series \"1909 World Series\"), defeating the [Detroit Tigers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1909_Detroit_Tigers_season \"1909 Detroit Tigers season\") for their first-ever world title.

The Pirates compete in [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball \"Major League Baseball\") (MLB) as a member club of the [National League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball) \"National League (baseball)\") (NL) [Central Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central \"National League Central\"). Founded as part of the [American Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_(19th_century) \"American Association (19th century)\") in 1881 under the name the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, the club joined the National League in 1887 and was a member of the [National League East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East \"National League East\") from 1969 through 1993. The Pirates have won five [World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series \"World Series\") championships, nine [National League pennants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_League_pennant_winners \"List of National League pennant winners\"), nine National League East division titles and made three appearances in the [Wild Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Wild_Card_Game \"Major League Baseball Wild Card Game\"). The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball at the start of the 20th century, playing in the [inaugural World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1903_World_Series \"1903 World Series\") in 1903 and winning their first title in [1909](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1909_World_Series \"1909 World Series\") behind [Honus Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honus_Wagner \"Honus Wagner\"). The Pirates took part in arguably the most famous World Series ending, winning the [1960 World Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_World_Series \"1960 World Series\") against the [New York Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees \"New York Yankees\") on a [walk-off home run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run \"Walk-off home run\") by [Bill Mazeroski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mazeroski \"Bill Mazeroski\"), the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run. They won again in [1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_World_Series \"1971 World Series\") behind [Roberto Clemente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Clemente \"Roberto Clemente\"), the first Latin-American enshrined in the [National Baseball Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame \"National Baseball Hall of Fame\"), and in [1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_World_Series \"1979 World Series\") under the leadership of [Willie Stargell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Stargell \"Willie Stargell\"). Since their last World Series in 1979, the Pirates have largely endured a period of great struggle. Since then, they have only had eleven winning seasons, six postseason appearances, three division titles, and have advanced just once in the postseason with a victory in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game.

The team joined the minor league [International Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_for_Professional_Base_Ball_Players \"International Association for Professional Base Ball Players\") in 1877, only to fold the following season.[\\[8\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-8) On October 15, 1881, [Denny McKnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_McKnight \"Denny McKnight\") held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club,[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates#cite_note-9) which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the [American Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_(19th_century) \"American Association (19th century)\").
